  <h2>OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h2>
    <p>I have, over the years, endeavoured to do my part in ministry to the wider Church. In diocesan life that has involved membership of the diocesan Doctrine and Worship Commission of the Diocese of Ottawa; membership of the Diocesan Executive Committee and Synod Management Committee. I have also chaired the Strategic Planning Committee for the Diocese of Ontario which led to a ten year plan which is now in its fifth year of implementation. At the level of the National church I have served on the Council of General Synod and for the last triennium was a member of the Faith Worship and Ministry Committee of the national church working in the area of Anglican relations. As a member of the House of Bishops I served on the Primate&rsquo;s Task Force on Alternative Episcopal Oversight and most recently on the House of Bishops Task Force on the Primacy. Through out my ministry I have placed emphasis considerable emphasis on ecumenical relations and since moving to Kingston have expanded that to include developing interfaith relations I also served asSpiritual Director for the Ottawa Cursillo Movement and served on several weekend teams. To provide balance in my life I have spent over ten years as a Cub and Beaver leader and coached children&rsquo;s soccer teams for over fifteen years. I also spent from 1988-1993 as Regimental Chaplain to the Governor General&rsquo;s Footguards. I have an interest in the ministry of wholeness and became a member of the Order of St Luke and conducted seminars in Healing ministry as well as introducing lay prayer teams for healing in three parishes.</p>
  
  <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>I have been married to Theo for almost forty-two years and we have five children and two grandchildren. My recreational pursuits are golf, at which I am not very good, and reading, whichover and above theological texts I do voraciously mostly in the area of medieval mystery novels. I like classical music and British comedies. I came late to ministry having first served a career in the Canadian Forces. I had always thought my ministry lay in small rural parishes, but that does not seem to have been the case.</p>
  
  <h2>MY VISION FOR THE PRIMACY</h2>
    <p>I believe that the role of the Primate must be deeply rooted in the House of Bishops. This is because above all else the Primate is first and foremost a bishop of the church and must represent the mood of the House to the Church. This, I believe, colours how the Primate functions in other areas of church life particularly with respect to the Council of General Synod. The Primate must be a willing listener to the many varied voices in the Church so as to ensure that all voices are heard in the Councils of the Church. </p>
  <p>The Primate must also be able to walk on the international stage as a voice of the Canadian church to the remainder of the Communion and be comfortable in an international environment. The Primate must also be a healer and reconciler drawing those with opposing views together to share and understand the reasons for differing opinions. The Primate whoever she or he is must hold the unity, not uniformity, of the church as a priority in the business of the Church. Finally I believe that there must be a full and detailed review of the role and duties of the Primate by a group of bishops, clergy and lay people to redefine the role for the twenty-first century. </p>
