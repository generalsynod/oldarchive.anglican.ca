    <h2>A VISION FOR THE PRIMACY<strong></strong></h2>
    <p>The Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada is first and foremost a Christian disciple. The Primate is also in ordered ministry as a bishop, called to guard the faith, unity and discipline of our church. It is not an easy calling but it is exciting and challenging. I will look at the Primacy of the Anglican Church of Canada through three different lenses: the Anglican Communion; the Anglican Church of Canada; and the world Christ died to save.</p>
  <p>It was the bishops of Canada who first requested a meeting of the bishops of the Anglican Communion. The Lambeth Conference continues to meet every ten years. In between the Primate has a primary ministry as the meeting point of the Anglican Church of Canada and the Anglican Communion. As such, the Primate&rsquo;s ministry is in part the ministry of Ambassador, visiting many other provinces of the Communion while never forgetting he/she is a Canadian Anglican. At this time relationships within the Communion are at risk. Recognizing that every province has something to teach and much to learn, I believe we need to strengthen our commitment to the Communion and our common faith. This is not the time to allow ourselves to be excluded from the international conversation and it will never be right to forego our membership in the Communion and become a Canadian sect.</p>
  <p>The Primate has a unique understanding of the particularities and catholicity of the dioceses and parishes of the Anglican Church of Canada. Once again there is a distressing tendency to think that we don&rsquo;t need each other. The leadership of the Primate needs to call for unity via the ministries of discernment, encouragement and teaching. Having no jurisdiction, the Primate must lead by example and inspiration. While having a relationship with the whole Anglican Church of Canada, the Primate needs to nurture especially the relationship with the House of Bishops, Council of General Synod and Church House. Moral and prophetic leadership are especially important in times of crisis. Most essential are prayer and the study of the faith. In recent Anglican history, I recognize such personal holiness and prophetic leadership in numerous primates; Archbishops Desmond Tutu and Rowan Williams come particularly to mind. In Canada I would welcome the development of the office of the Primate as a teacher of the Christian faith.</p>
  <p>The Canadian Primate embodies the memory and story of our church. As we continue in our pilgrimage of healing and reconciliation with our indigenous brothers and sisters, the Primate, with the National Indigenous Bishop and others, will have a special ministry incorporating story and symbol in order to celebrate the faith and draw the faithful together in community. At this time when the General Synod is experiencing financial stress, and the viability of many parishes and dioceses is in question, I believe it is the vocation of the Primate to speak out on behalf of those less affluent dioceses. It is time for the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada to offer leadership in stewardship education and to model cut-backs so to encourage the flourishing of the church at the local level.</p>
  <p>Our Primate needs to have a voice that addresses and is in dialogue with our government leaders. Canada is not a Christian country but that doesn&rsquo;t mean there is no place for the prophetic call to peace, justice and an ecologically sound environment. It is the Church&rsquo;s vocation in Christ to waken the conscience of Canada. The Primate is best situated to deliver and articulate statements of our Church to the elected leaders of our nation. In terms of the global village it is the role of our Primate to work alongside other church leaders to address ethical and moral questions and to make statements about political issues. Both inside and outside Canada the Anglican Church needs to give voice to the Gospel of Jesus Christ in concert with other Christians, and in response to the leading of the Spirit.</p>
