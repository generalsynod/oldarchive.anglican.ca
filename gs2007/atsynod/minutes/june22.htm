  <p><em><strong>At 2 p.m. the Prolocutor declared that an election had occurred.</strong></em></p>
  <p align="right"><a name="29" id="29"></a><em><strong>Act 29</strong></em></p>
  <p>He thanked the scrutineers for their work.</p>
  <p>The Prolocutor, Deputy Prolocutor and General Secretary delivered word of the election to the Order of Bishops.  The Order of Bishops returned to the Church of the Holy Trinity to a standing ovation.  The Primate presented Bishop Fred Hiltz and proclaimed him as the new Primate Elect.  Bishop Hiltz accepted.</p>
  <p><strong>The Primate Elect addressed Synod and his remarks, in part, included the following:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>I would like to express my appreciation to the other Primatial candidates.  I will enter the Primacy with a great deal of trepidation, as it is a daunting and overwhelming task.  I love this Church and I have always loved it.  I pray to God that I will always give generously of myself to it.  As I currently reside in the Eastern part of the country, I will need to get to know Central, Western and Northern Canada and, hopefully, I can arrange to spend plenty of time visiting the areas I do not know.  I will work very hard to further the key initiatives that have already occurred in this Synod around the Church re-committing itself in wonderful ways to the Church in the North.  I look forward to visiting the dioceses within the Council of the North and will do everything I can to support them.</em></p>
    <p><em>I am a supporter of Full Communion with the ELCIC and will do my best to ensure that this relationship is deepened and nurtured at every level of the Church.  I shall look forward to meeting the new National Bishop and continuing the relationship.  I shall also do my best, with your help and prayers, to be a Primate who will draw the Church together, to keep members in dialogue and at the table, so that we may remain together in Christ.</em></p>
    <p><em>My hope and prayer for our Church is that the world will be able to look at us as &lsquo;gospel people&rsquo;.  Please pray for my wife and I as we prepare to leave Nova Scotia for Toronto.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Primate Elect delivered the benediction.</p>
  <p>The Primate, Archbishop Hutchison, thanked Synod for its work and advised that the Primate Elect would be installed as the 13th Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada in Winnipeg on June 25, 2007.</p>
  <p>The Prolocutor thanked the Rector and parish members of the Church of the Holy Trinity for their kind generosity and hospitality.<br />

    <li><em>receipt of resolutions &ndash; 9.00 p.m.</em><br />
    </li>

    <li>The national youth website <a href="http://www.generation.anglican.ca">www.generation.anglican.ca</a>, which was initiated by the Primate&rsquo;s office.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The aim of these various initiatives is to resource, provide training for and encourage local parish and diocesan youth ministries.</p>
  <p><strong>Generation 2008</strong>, a National Youth Ministry Forum (for youth workers, youth ministry staff and clergy) was announced.  It will be held in June 2008 and details are available at the website: <a href="http://www.generation.anglican.ca">www.generation.anglican.ca</a>.</p>

Bishop Moxley advised that Synod would be asked to authorize additional funding for youth initiatives from the General Synod budget.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>Special Presentation to Bishop Charles Arthurson</h2>
  <p>Archbishop John Clarke and Bishop Anthony Burton made a special presentation to Bishop Charles Arthurson (Saskatchewan), the first indigenous Bishop in the Anglican Church of Canada who was attending his last General Synod.  Some of the words used to describe &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo; were &ndash; <em>sincere, honest, a friend, tireless, a pioneer of episcopal aboriginal ministry who performed his duties with sincere grace and patience</em>.  Bishop Arthurson responded in Cree and English and gave thanks to God for his health and his family.  He advised Synod that he will celebrate his 70th birthday on July 3rd at the Calgary Stampede!</p>
  <p><em>The Prolocutor took the Chair.<br />
  </em></p>
  <h2>Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP) Presentation</h2>
  <p>Ms. Donna Bomberry, Coordinator for Indigenous Ministries, introduced the session.  It commenced with a Drum Song by the Rev. Mervin Wolfleg during which all ACIP members and Partners entered the hall from the east, south, west and north.</p>
  <p>The ACIP Co-Chairs (Rev. Gloria Moses and Archdeacon Sidney Black) welcomed everyone to this special ACIP event to celebrate the appointment (on January 4, 2007) of the first National Indigenous Anglican Bishop, the Rt. Rev. Mark MacDonald.  Ms. Bomberry provided the history and background since 1993 of the Indigenous Ministries&rsquo; Covenant Journey and the Primate welcomed Bishop MacDonald, his wife Virginia and their three children to the Anglican Church community in Canada.</p>
  <p>Bishop MacDonald greeted Synod members in the native language of Alaska, saying that &ldquo;<em>you are all my relatives</em>&rdquo;.  He paid tribute to all indigenous bishops in Canada &ndash; and to Bishop Charles Arthurson in particular &ndash; and reflected on the issue of indigenous peoples being treated like aliens in their own land.  He quoted from the Book of Revelation (Chapter 3) about the words of the Holy One, the true one, who has the key of David, <em>who opens (doors) that no one will shut and shuts (doors) that no one opens</em>.  He concluded with the hope that Jesus will be able to close a door to misery that no one will ever be able to open again.</p>
  <p>Numerous visitors were acknowledged, including the Secretary General of the Anglican Indigenous Network, Mr. Malcolm Naea Chun from Hawaii.</p>
  <p>Representatives of many First Nations&rsquo; groups and communities presented gifts to Bishop MacDonald, his wife and children.  Each Synod member also received a gift.<br />
