  <h2>Monday, June 25, 2007</h2>
  <h2>Orders of the Day</h2>
  <p>Mrs. Barbara Burrows reviewed the Orders of the Day.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>Resolutions</h2>
  <h2>Revision of Canon XXI on Marriage </h2>
  <p>Moved by:		Dean Peter Elliott<br />
    Seconded by:		Chancellor Ronald Stevenson</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That this General Synod request the Council of General Synod to consider a revision of Canon XXI (On Marriage) including theological rationale to allow marriage of all legally qualified persons and to report back to General Synod 2010.</p>

  </p>
  <h2>A Statement from the House of Bishops to the<br />
    Members of General Synod</h2>
  <p>Bishop Donald Phillips, Secretary of the House of Bishops, and Bishop Patrick Yu introduced this Statement.  (<em>See <a href="/gs2007/atsynod/minutes/AppendixL.pdf">Appendix L</a></em>)<br />
  </p>
  <h2>House of Bishops Statement on Pastoral Care of Same Sex Couples </h2>
  <p>Moved by:	Bishop Michael Bedford-Jones<br />
    Seconded by:	Ms. Suzanne Lawson</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That this General Synod welcome the Statement of the House of Bishops of October, 2006, urging the church to show pastoral understanding and sensitivity to all same-sex couples, including those civilly married, and committing the House to develop pastoral strategies to give effect to the acceptance of gays and lesbians to whom we are already committed by previous General Synods and COGS resolutions, House of Bishops guidelines and Lambeth Conference statements.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Friendly Amendment</strong></em></p>
  <p>The Rev. Canon Paul Jennings proposed a friendly amendment that the Statement issued in April 2007 by the House of Bishops (and included as a Memorial in the Convening Circular) also be included in this resolution.  This amendment was declined by the mover and seconder.</p>
  <p><em><strong>The original motion was then put and &ndash; </strong></em></p>

  </p>
  <p><em><strong>Point of Personal Privilege</strong></em></p>
  <p>Bishop Michael Ingham rose to correct several statements made in the House with respect to the Diocese of New Westminster.</p>
  <p>He said:  &ldquo;<em>It is a small minority of people who are getting a lot of press attention.  I would not want General Synod to have the impression that those who speak from outside our diocese and the Anglican Church of Canada represent theological conservatives in the Diocese of New Westminster, the vast majority of whom remain within the diocese and are represented here in our delegation to General Synod.&rdquo;</em><br />
  </p>
  <h2>ACC-13 Resolution 4 </h2>
  <p>The revised resolution was presented.</p>
  <p>Moved by:		Bishop Susan Moxley<br />
    Seconded by:		Ms. Suzanne Lawson</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That this General Synod:</p>
    <p>i. ratify Sections a-d of the proposed constitutional changes for the Anglican Consultative Council, as proposed in ACC-13 Resolution 4; and</p>
    <p>ii. not ratify ACC-13 Resolution 4, Section e) of the proposed constitutional changes for the Anglican Consultative Council.</p>

  <p>The resolution suspended earlier was returned and the list of speakers was noted.  Canon Falby advised that the mover and seconder had accepted a <em>friendly amendment</em> from Ms. Heather Dixon (and the revisions are <u>underlined</u>).  The motion now reads:</p>

      2) renumbering sections 5 to 11 to be sections 3 to <u>9</u>; and<br />
      3) amending all cross-references to sections 6, 7 and 8 to refer to sections <u>3 and 4</u> respectively.</p>

    <p><em><strong>a) 	Amendments to the Declaration of Principles</strong></em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>	i)	The Solemn Declaration of the Declaration of Principles belongs in a particular historic context and therefore cannot be altered or amended.<br />
        ii)	An amendment to the Declaration of Principles can be considered only when a majority of each Order is present at the session of the General Synod.<br />
        iii)	Subject to subsection iv), an amendment to the Declaration of Principles shall take effect when passed by a two-thirds majority in each Order.<br />
        iv)	An amendment to sections 6, 7 and 8 of the Declaration of Principles shall take effect only when the General Synod has adopted it in the manner prescribed in subsection iii), and the synods of each of the ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada have consented to it.<br />
        v)	The synod of an ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Church of Canada shall be deemed to have consented to an amendment to section 6, 7 or 8 of the Declaration of Principles adopted by the General Synod if no resolution proposing consent to the amendment has been voted upon in the provincial synod before the expiration of 3 years from the date the amendment was passed by the General Synod.<br />
        vi)	Where a proposed amendment to the Declaration of Principles has been defeated by the General Synod, or where an amendment to section 6, 7 or 8 of the Declaration of Principles passed by the General Synod has not taken effect pursuant to subsection iv), the proposed amendment may be introduced again at any subsequent session of the General Synod.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>b)	Amendments to the Constitution</strong></em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>i)	An amendment to a section of the Constitution which has its origin in the Declaration of Principles must be consistent with the Principle concerned.<br />

    <blockquote>
      <p> i)	All Canons dealing with doctrine, and amendments to such Canons, shall take effect when passed by a two-thirds majority in each Order at two successive sessions of the General Synod, the Canon or amendment proposed having been referred for consideration to diocesan and provincial synods, following the first approval of the General Synod.<br />
        ii)	All Canons dealing with matters other than doctrine or amendments to such Canons, shall take effect when passed by a two-thirds majority of the Order of Bishops, and of the Orders of Clergy and Laity voting together.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>d) 	Amendments to the Rules of Order and Procedure</strong></em></p>
    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p><em><strong>e) 	Amendments on Second Reading at Synod</strong></em></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> i)	Where a resolution proposing a Canon dealing with doctrine or an amendment to such a Canon has been:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>a) 	passed at one session of the General Synod,<br />
          b)	referred for consideration to all diocesan and provincial synods, and<br />
          c)	brought before a second session of the General Synod,</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>it shall be in order for the General Synod to adopt any amendment to the resolution which does not alter the resolution in any substantive way but which merely improves the clarity or form of the resolution.</p>
      <p> ii)	A resolution amended pursuant to subsection i) shall take effect if passed by the required majority at the second session notwithstanding the amendment.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

    Seconded by:		Mr. George Power</p>

      <em><a name="49" id="49"></a>Act 49</em></strong></p>
  <p>Bishop Moxley explained that, as a result of restructuring, there were a reduced number of members on some committees.  Most dioceses have 1-2 (or at most 3) representatives.  Youth members are appointed (i.e. anyone under the age of 27 years).</p>
