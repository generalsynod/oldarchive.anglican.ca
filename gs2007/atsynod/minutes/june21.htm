  <h2>Thursday, June 21, 2007</h2>
  <h2>Joint Anglican / Lutheran Day</h2>
  <p>Anglicans and Lutherans were welcomed to the Winnipeg Convention Centre by the Rev. Dr. Richard Leggett .  The theme for the day was &lsquo;<em><strong>Water</strong></em>&rsquo; &ndash; the water of baptism and issues relating to water in today&rsquo;s world.  Everyone participated in the Celebration of the Eucharist and combined table groups discussed what they knew, or didn&rsquo;t know, about each other&rsquo;s churches.</p>
  <p>The theme speaker was Dr. Sallie McFague, Distinguished Theologian in Residence at the Vancouver School of Theology, well known as an eco-theologian and activist in the movement to &ldquo;green&rdquo; the Church. <br />
  </p>
  <h2>National Aboriginal Day</h2>
  <p>This &ldquo;<em>Day</em>&rdquo; was celebrated by nine Canadian church organizations commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the signing of the 1987 ecumenical statement entitled &ldquo;A New Covenant&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>At a ceremony held during the Joint Anglican / Lutheran Meeting, Church leaders (including Archbishop Andrew Hutchison, Evangelical Lutheran Bishop Raymond Schultz and Roman Catholic Archbishop James Weisgerber) renewed their commitment to the Covenant in support of aboriginal peoples&rsquo; continuing struggle for justice and self-determination.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>In Memoriam &ndash; Mr. Joseph Harvey</h2>
  <p>The Primate advised that Mr. Joseph Harvey, an exhibitor at General Synod from Split Lake in the Diocese of Keewatin, had died suddenly in a Winnipeg Hospital at 12.15 p.m. today.  Synod members observed one minute of silence in his memory and a prayer was offered for his life and service.  <em>May he rest in peace and rise in glory.</em><br />
  </p>
  <h2>Welcome to Partners</h2>
  <h2>The Rt. Rev. Patrick Mwachiko</h2>
  <p>The Director of Partnerships, Dr. Eleanor Johnson, introduced and welcomed Bishop Mwachiko from the Diocese of Masasi, Tanzania, and he addressed Synod members.  (<a href="/gs2007/atsynod/minutes/AppendixH.pdf"><em>See Appendix H</em></a>)</p>
  <h2>The Rt. Rev. Pie and Mrs. Clavera Ntukamazina</h2>
  <p>Ms. Cheryl Curtis, the Director of PWRDF, introduced Pie Ntukamazina, Bishop of Bujumbura, Burundi.  He thanked the Anglican Church of Canada for its continuing support during times when his country was &ldquo;in trouble&rdquo;, noting that &ldquo;a good friend&rdquo; is someone who appears when you are in danger.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Ntukamazina reported on the work of the Mothers&rsquo; Union, which is undertaking educational, medical, restoration and recovery work following the Civil War in Burundi.</p>
  <p>The Primate thanked everyone for their presentations.<br />

  <h2>Resolution</h2>
  <h2>Report of the Windsor Report Response Group </h2>
  <p>Moved by:		Bishop Colin Johnson<br />
    Seconded by:		Archdeacon Peter Fenty</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That this General Synod endorse the report of the Windsor Report Response Group, as adopted by the Council of General Synod (March 2007), and that the following be forwarded, along with the report, to the Anglican Communion Office and the Provinces of the Anglican Communion.</p>
    <p>The Anglican Church of Canada:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>reaffirms its commitment to full membership and participation in the life, witness and structures of the Anglican Communion;</li>
      <li>reaffirms its commitment to the Lambeth Quadrilateral, as received by our church in 1893;</li>
      <li>expresses its desire and readiness to continue our participation in the ongoing life of the Communion through partnerships and visits, theological and biblical study, in order to foster Communion relationships, including the Listening Process and the development and possible adoption of an Anglican Covenant;</li>
      <li>reaffirms its mutual responsibility and interdependence with our Anglican sisters and brothers in furthering the mission of the church;</li>
      <li>notes that, in response to the Windsor Report, the Diocese of New Westminster expressed regret, and the House of Bishops effected a moratorium on the blessing of same-sex unions;</li>
      <li>calls upon those archbishops and other bishops who believe that it is their conscientious duty to intervene in Provinces, dioceses and parishes other than their own to implement paragraph 155 of the Windsor Report and to seek an accommodation with the bishops of the dioceses whose parishes they have taken into their own care; and</li>
      <li>commits itself to participation in the Listening Process and to share with member churches of the Communion the study of human sexuality which continues to take place, in the light of Scripture, tradition and reason.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Amendment</strong></em></p>
  <p>Moved by:		Rev. Henry Dunbar<br />

    <p>That the word &lsquo;endorse&rsquo; in paragraph 1 be changed to &lsquo;<em>receive</em>&rsquo;.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>That the following words be added at the end of item #1:
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>and commits to adhere to the principles and provisions of the Windsor Report, and urges all dioceses to do so, including:<br />
            a) upholding Lambeth Resolution 1.10 as the current standard of Anglican teaching on the matter; and<br />
            b) upholding a moratorium on the blessing of same sex unions.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>That the following new paragraph #6 be added and the paragraphs #6 and #7 be renumbered as #7 and #8 as follows:
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>6. shall urge all dioceses, notwithstanding the previous practice of any diocese, to comply with the moratorium.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
