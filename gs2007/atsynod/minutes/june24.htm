  <p>At 11.52 a.m., the Primate suspended debate until after lunch and requested members in line at the microphones to register with the Synod secretaries.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>General Synod&rsquo;s Pastoral Care Team</h2>
  <p>The General Secretary identified the members of this team.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>In Memoriam &ndash; The Very Rev. Paul James</h2>
  <p>The Primate advised that this former member of General Synod and Dean Emeritus of the Diocese of Quebec had died in Stratford, Ontario.  Synod members observed one minute of silence in his memory and the Primate commended him into the hands of God.  <em>May he rest in peace and rise in glory.</em><br />
  </p>
  <h2>
    Noon Reflections</h2>
  <p>Archbishop John Sentamu&rsquo;s reflections concluded with members of Synod holding hands and saying to each other &ndash; <em>&ldquo;I could not live without you&rdquo;.</em><br />
  </p>
  <h2>Information Dialogues</h2>
  <p>Members attended a second session of Information Dialogues.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>New National Bishop of ELCIC</h2>
  <p>Dean Peter Wall introduced Bishop Elect Susan Johnson and she briefly addressed Synod.  Archbishop Hutchison and Bishop Hiltz, Primate Elect, both joined her on the podium and expressed their congratulations.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>Report on Indian Residential Schools</h2>
  <p>Dr. Eleanor Johnson, Director of Partnerships, advised that this presentation was undertaken for the benefit of former students of residential schools and their families in their journey towards justice and healing.  The detailed report included the following sections:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA)</li>
    <li>Anglican Amending Agreement </li>
    <li>The Healing Fund</li>
    <li>Truth and Reconciliation</li>
    <li>Archival support.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The Primate expressed deep appreciation to the team members for their work.</p>
  <p>Archdeacon Larry Beardy, a former residential school student, asked Synod members for their prayers on his journey and he expressed his appreciation to the Anglican Church of Canada for its leadership and its repentance.</p>
  <p>Ms. Esther Wesley, Healing Fund Coordinator at the National Office, and Dr. Johnson, responded to numerous questions.</p>
  <p>Ms. Ethel Moses, also a former residential school student, requested each diocese to open its archives <em>at once</em> and suggested that they remain open later than August 2007.  Dr. Johnson advised that the Archives at the National Office have always been open and that the Archivist, Ms. Nancy Hurn, will provide as much information as is available in a timely manner.</p>
  <h2>Resolutions</h2>
  <h2>Blessing of Same Sex Unions &ndash; Diocesan Authority and Jurisdiction </h2>
  <p>Debate resumed on the following resolution suspended earlier and, as there were 31 members on the &lsquo;speakers&rsquo; list, the Primate urged everyone to use their time prudently.</p>
  <p>Moved by:		Mr. John Brewin<br />
    Seconded by:		Rev. Canon Garth Bulmer</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That this General Synod affirm the authority and jurisdiction of any diocesan synod, with the concurrence of its bishop, to authorize the blessing of committed same sex unions.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Amendment</strong></em></p>
  <p>Moved by:		Rev. Canon Michael Oulton<br />
    Seconded by:		Archdeacon Jim McShane</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That the words &lsquo;committed same-sex unions&rsquo; be deleted and replaced with the words &ldquo;<em>civil same-sex marriages</em>&rdquo;.<br />
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Primate sought advice from the Assessors as to whether this amendment was in order.  The Assessors advised it <em>was</em> in order because the amendment is not the direct negative of the motion.  Voting for the amendment would not be the same as voting &lsquo;No&rsquo; to the motion.  The Primate then ruled that the amendment was in order.</p>
  <p><em><strong>The amendment was then put and &ndash;</strong></em></p>
  <p align="right"><strong>DEFEATED</strong></p>
  <p><em><strong>Friendly Amendment</strong></em></p>
  <p>The Rev. Canon Paul Jennings proposed a friendly amendment to change the words &ldquo;<em>affirm</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;grant&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>of</em>&rdquo; to &ldquo;to&rdquo; &ndash; i.e.  <em>That this General Synod <u>grant</u> authority and jurisdiction <u>to</u> any diocesan, etc.</em></p>
  <p>Following receipt of an opinion from Chancellor Stevenson, Canon Jennings withdrew his friendly amendment.</p>
  <p>Bishop Claude Miller appealed for prayer for God&rsquo;s grace for bishops when they return home.</p>
  <p>Debate resumed on the original motion.</p>
  <p><em><strong>Friendly Amendment</strong></em></p>
  <p>The following friendly amendment from Mr. Stephen Koning was accepted by the mover and seconder.  The amended motion now reads (revisions are <u>underlined</u>):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>That this General Synod affirm the authority and jurisdiction of any diocesan synod:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>with the concurrence of <u>the diocesan</u> Bishop; <em><u>and</u></em></li>
      <li><u>in a manner which respects the conscience of the incumbent and the will of the parish</u>,</li>
    </ol>
    <p>to authorize the blessing of committed same sex unions.<br />
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Point of Order</strong></em></p>
  <p>On behalf of six members of Synod, the Rev. Stephen Peake raised a point of order requiring Synod members to vote by orders.  The members were:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Rev. Stephen Peake, Rev. Ajit John, Mr. Stephen Masson, Rev. Canon Kimberley Beard, Rev. Stephen London and Bishop William Anderson.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Prior to the vote, the Primate prayed that God would grant wisdom and courage to Synod members.<br />
  </p>
  <p><em><strong>The amended resolution was then put by Orders and &ndash;</strong></em></p>
  <p align="right"><strong>CARRIED IN THE ORDER OF LAITY<br />

  <p><em>We extend our warmest greetings to the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada and to the Right Reverend Fred Hiltz in his election to the Primacy of the Anglican Church of Canada.</em></p>
  <p><em>This Executive also notes the deep significance of the installation of the Right Reverend Mark MacDonald as the first National Indigenous Bishop of the Anglican Church of Canada. </em></p>
  <p><em>We celebrate the many expressions of our shared partnerships in God&rsquo;s mission and our common desire for right relationships within Canada and throughout the world. </em></p>
  <p><em>We, the members of the Executive of the General Council, on behalf of the people of The United Church of Canada, offer our prayers for the continuing sessions of the General Synod.  May God richly bless your time together so that you may be strengthened and encouraged as followers of Jesus.</em><br />
  </p>
  <h2>Dr. Susan Brown, Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops</h2>

  </p>
  <h2>The Rev. Canon Petero Sabune, The Episcopal Church</h2>
  <p>Bishop Michael Ingham, who represented the Anglican Church of Canada on the Episcopal Church&rsquo;s Executive Council, introduced Canon Sabune who then addressed Synod.  It was noted that he is the Chaplain to Sing Sing Prison.<br />
  </p>
  <h2>The Primatial Farewell &ndash; A farewell to Archbishop Andrew Hutchison</h2>
  <p>General Synod members, partners and guests gathered at the Radisson Hotel in Winnipeg for a <em>Rendezvous in Rupert&rsquo;s Land</em> &ndash; a banquet honouring Archbishop Andrew Hutchison, who served as Primate from June 4, 2004 to June 25, 2007.  Archbishop John Clarke, the Metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert&rsquo;s Land, was the Master of Ceremonies.  Numerous Synod members and guests paid tribute to Archbishop Hutchison and a video on his primacy was shown.</p>
  <p>Archbishop Hutchison responded and the Bishop of Rupert&rsquo;s Land, the Rt. Rev. Donald Phillips, concluded the evening with prayer.</p>
