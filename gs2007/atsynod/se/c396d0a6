  <h2>How Will The Selections Be Made?</h2>
  <p>High resolution digital photographs sent as j-pegs will be accepted as submissions to &ldquo;Sacred Expressions.&rdquo; Out of the submissions, a creative team will select the artwork that will be shown at General Synod. It may not be possible to use all submissions so selection will be based on the following criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the piece reflects or expands on the theme &ldquo;Draw The Circle Wide; Draw It Wider Still.&rdquo;</li>
    <li>the piece is represented well in a high resolution j-peg of a digital photograph</li>
    <li>the piece has been created by an Anglican artist (you do not have to be active in your church &ndash; you just have to consider yourself a member of the Anglican community).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Digital photographs of any sort of art expression will be considered &ndash; you are limited only by your own imagination. Painting, sculpture, fabric art, installations, even photographs themselves will be considered. </p>
  <h2><strong>The Selection Committee</strong></h2>
  
  <p><strong> The Venerable Donna Ball &ndash; Chair, General Synod 2007 Worship Committee</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Background<br />
  </strong>Donna was ordained a Priest at St. John's Cathedral in Rupert's Land in May, 1991. She is delighted to be serving as Intentional Interim at St. George's Parish in Winnipeg at this time. Donna has served the Diocese and National Church in a variety of capacities. Among these are: elected member at Diocesan Council and Executive; General Synod delegate a number of times; participant on National Church committees (including work related to ethics, as well as projects involving worship); co-creator and coordinator for Diocesan project 'Building Healthy Communities'; coordinator of ministry placements for the diocese. She has served as Diocesan Archdeacon since July, 2000. </p>
  <p>Donna's particular passions with regard to her life and work in the church include: exploring and discovering faithful ways for the church to move forward in this post modern context; leading faith communities into a renewed commitment to discipleship (beginning with a strong rootedness in the sacred text and teachings of our faith,helping faith communities to grow into an increasingly deeper understanding of the intimate connection between liturgy and justice; assisting congregations to maximize on the great opportunities associated with 'interim' times.</p><p>
    Donna is an enthusiastic supporter of the arts and is thrilled to be involved with &ldquo;Sacred Expressions.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am really excited about this project,&rdquo; she says &ldquo;and I believe it will add a new dimension to worship at General Synod. Incorporating visual expressions of the theme artists from across the country is, in itself, one way to draw the circle wide; reflecting on these artistic offerings within the context of worship will enrich our goal to &lsquo;draw it wider still&rsquo;. &rdquo;</p>
