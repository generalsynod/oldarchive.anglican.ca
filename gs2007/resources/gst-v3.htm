  <br />
Greetings! <br />
<br />
By now you will have received the Convening Circular for the 38th General Synod. The Information Section (yellow) contains information that will be helpful to you prior to leaving for Synod and while you are at Synod. <br />
<p align="center"> <strong><em>Information Highlights </em></strong> </p>
<p> <br />
    <strong>Transportation and Accommodation</strong> <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Response to General Synod has been such that delegates and guests at General Synod will now be accommodated in three hotels: The Marlborough Hotel, The Radisson Skyview Winnipeg and York The Hotel. Contact information for the hotels is listed below and a map can be found <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=117248548725536871941.000001128ba27d9ba1db6&amp;ll=49.894938,-97.138968&amp;spn=0.014293,0.028796&amp;z=15&amp;om=1">here</a>. If you have requested accommodation at General Synod, you will be notified by separate email which of the three hotels you will be staying in.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>On arrival at the Winnipeg International Airport, you will be met by volunteers from the GS Local Arrangements Committee. Watch for the volunteers who will be holding signs that say<em> </em><em>Welcome General Synod</em>. Volunteers will be aware if your flight has been delayed and they will be expecting you. If you are unable to locate a volunteer, please contact the Marlborough Hotel -<strong> </strong><strong>204-942-6411. Note: Arrangements have been made for transportation from the airport to the hotels only for those participants who indicated on their registration forms that they require a pickup at the airport.</strong><br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The volunteers will tag your luggage and take you to your hotel where you will register for your room.  <strong>You will be asked for a credit card at the hotel registration desk. Room and taxes <U>only</U> will be paid by General Synod on its master account. You are responsible for incidentals (telephone calls, movies, laundry, etc.) which will be charged to your credit card.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Registration</strong> <br />
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>General Synod registration will be in the lobby of the Marlborough Hotel beginning at 1:00 p.m on Monday, June 18.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  When you register you will be given a name tag. You are asked to wear this nametag at<U> </U><U>all</U> times. If you have signed up for a meal plan, your name tag will serve as your<strong> </strong><strong>meal ticket</strong> and will identify you to the hotel staff. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> In addition, you will be given the following: <br />
      <br />
        <ul>
      <li>A folder containing updates to the Convening Circular. Please add these to your binder so that you will have a <strong>complete</strong> set of resolutions, etc. for Synod; the number of the table(s) where your diocesan group will sit during plenary sessions; list of meeting rooms; the Home Group you have been assigned to and the location for your home group as well as other important information.</li>
      <li> A bag with various items for your comfort. The bags are designed to hold your Convening Circular binder and assorted other items that you may wish to take to plenary each day.</li>
      <li> A cushion made by the parishes of the Diocese of Rupert&#8217;s Land. You will find this cushion helpful throughout Synod.<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<strong>Agenda</strong> <br />
<ul>
  <li>  Each day,<em> </em><em>The Orders for the Day</em>, (a detailed agenda for the day) will be prepared. The<em> Orders for the Day</em> will include a list of resolutions to be dealt with that day and other agenda items as well as notice, timing, location and instructions for agenda that is scheduled outside the Plenary Hall.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>At the beginning of the each day copies of<em> </em><em>The Daily Report</em>, an unofficial compilation of the previous day's proceedings will be distributed. Members, please put these in your Convening Circular. On your return home they make reporting back to your diocese easy.<strong> <br />
    </strong>  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Meals </strong><strong><em> </em><em>(for those who have registered for a meal plan)</em></strong> <br />
<ul>
  <li>  Meals will be served at the Marlborough Hotel except when otherwise indicated on the Orders of the Day. <strong>Please wear your nametag as it is also your meal plan ticket</strong>. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  The first meal will be lunch on Monday, June 18. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Buffet tables will be set up in the foyer outside Eton Hall and the Kensington Room on the Mezzanine Level. Seating is in the Eton Hall and the Kensington Room. As soon as you have made your choices please move into the seating areas so that others can have access to the buffet tables. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Beverages are self-serve and located in both the Eton Hall and the Kensington Room. <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  A second dining area, Churchill's on the main level, will also be used. <br />
  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Other Information</strong> <br />
<ul>
  <li> Dress for Synod is &#8220;dress casual&#8221;. However for occasions such as the Opening and Closing Services and Rendezvous in Rupert&#8217;s Land you may wish to dress more formally.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Bring comfortable shoes <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> The weather will be hot but do bring a warm sweater or jacket and don&#8217;t forget an umbrella <br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>  Winnipeg has a large mosquito population and you may wish to bring mosquito repellent for times when you will be outdoors.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li> It is useful to bring a 4&#8221; D-ring binder for your Convening Circular. </li>
  </ul>
<p> With delegates, displayers, presenters, partners, special guest and staff and volunteers, we expect that there will be approximately 500 people at Synod. With any group of this size there are always logistical problems getting from one place to another, lining up for meals, etc. Patience will be required. The Planning Committee, Local Arrangements and staff have been hard at work doing everything they can to ensure that day to day activities run smoothly. If problems arise, please do not hesitate to speak to one of our General Synod staff. They will identified with &#8220;<em>ASK ME&#8221;</em> buttons in addition to their nametags that identify them as staff.<br />
    <br />
    We look forward to seeing you in Winnipeg. <br />
