  <p>Local taxis will provide service between downtown Winnipeg to the Winnipeg International Airport, Via Rail and Bus Station. If you are traveling with a
    group of 4 or more people, ask the limousine drivers
    what their flat-rate fare is between the airport and
    downtown Winnipeg. It could work out to be less
    than taxi fare.</p>
