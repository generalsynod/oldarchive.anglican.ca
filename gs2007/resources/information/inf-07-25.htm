  <h1>Task</h1>
  <p>It is the responsibility of the committee:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>to receive, and prepare for debate, resolutions proposed for the consideration of the Synod;</li>
    <li>to ensure that proposed resolutions contain clear and concise statements of what is intended by the sponsors;</li>
    <li>to consolidate, and, if necessary, reword resolutions which deal with the same subject, after consultation with the sponsors;</li>
    <li>generally to ensure that the resolutions do not contradict the resolutions procedures which form part of these guidelines;</li>
    <li>to prepare and present a list of proposed &lsquo;no-debate&rsquo; motions;<strong></strong></li>
    <li>to reject, or return for amendment, any resolution it considers to be outside the jurisdiction of the General Synod.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Resolutions Procedures</h1>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>All resolutions not already printed in the Convening Circular, except those of a procedural or courtesy nature, or that arise in the course of debate, shall be written on the prescribed form and submitted to the General Secretary for consideration by the committee before being put to the Synod.&nbsp; <em>(The General Secretary will give the notice of motion to the Chair of the Resolutions Committee who will assign it a number and at the close of that sitting present it as a notice of motion.)</em></li>
    <li>The committee shall not debate the merits of any proposed resolution, but will ensure that it contains a clear and concise statement of what is proposed.</li>
    <li>Any resolution presented to the committee may be accompanied by an explanatory note setting forth the consideration leading to the proposal.&nbsp; This note <em>will not form part</em> of the resolution preambles (i.e. <em>&ldquo;Whereas&rdquo;, etc. etc.)</em> </li>
    <li>The committee is authorized to consolidate and, if necessary, re-word resolutions which deal with the same subject, with the understanding that, in doing so, the committee will consult with the sponsors of the resolutions.</li>
    <li>The sponsors of any resolution which is recommended for change by the committee must be consulted and asked for their agreement to change(s) proposed.&nbsp; If agreement cannot be reached, the committee has authority to present its version, and the sponsors will have the opportunity to propose any amendments they believe desirable.</li>
    <li>Any notice of motion, except one of a procedural or a courtesy nature, will not be<strong> </strong>received beyond the time stated on the agenda for the reception of notices of motions except with the consent of a two-thirds majority of the Synod.</li>
    <li>Any resolution which requires the expenditure of funds, the source of which has not been identified prior to the Synod session [<em>Handbook, Rules of Order and Procedure 15b<strong>) </strong></em>shall be referred to the Expenditures Committee by the General Secretary or the Chair of the Resolutions Committee.</li>
    <li>Resolutions, which are received after the printing of the Convening Circular, will be dealt with in the order in which they are received or at the discretion of the Agenda Committee.</li>
