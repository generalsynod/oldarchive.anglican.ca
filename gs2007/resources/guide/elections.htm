  <p><em>The Primate</em>: An important task for this General Synod will be to elect a new Primate. The &ldquo;upper house&rdquo; of General Synod (the House of Bishops) will nominate candidates from among its members prior to the convening of Synod.&nbsp; Election day Friday, June 22nd will begin with a celebration of the Eucharist, at Holy Trinity Anglican Church after which the House of Bishops will withdraw to another venue and the &ldquo;lower house&rdquo; (the Orders of Clergy and Laity) will vote.&nbsp; The Prolocutor, (next to the Primate, the Senior Officer of Synod) will convene the sitting and preside. </p>
  <p><em>The Prolocutor and Deputy Prolocutor:</em> In addition, elections will be held for Prolocutor and Deputy Prolocutor of General Synod. The Prolocutor will be elected on Thursday, June 21st and the Deputy Prolocutor on Saturday, June 23rd.&nbsp; Members of standing committees and councils will also be elected at Synod.</p>
  <p><em>Council of General Synod:</em> Each diocese is asked for three nominations from among its own members for the Council of General Synod (CoGS): one each from the Orders of Bishop, Clergy and Laity. One of these will be elected at the provincial caucus meeting during Synod to represent your diocese on CoGS. While the election process itself can get complicated, experience has proven that the procedure works. Instructions will be given at election time. You may also want to consult Appendix G in the Handbook of General Synod.</p>
  <p><em>Standing Committees:</em> Prior to General Synod we encourage you to meet with other members from your diocese to nominate persons to stand for election to the standing committees. Involvement with a committee can be a very rewarding experience as you work together with others from across the country. It also involves a time commitment over a three-year period, including some weekend travel and weekday meetings. Talk to current members of such bodies to find out more.</p>
  <p>If you would like to be nominated, speak to your diocesan caucus. Membership on standing committees is not limited to members of General Synod as there are, in most cases, specific skills needed by the committees. It is up to the Nominating Committee to review the nominations and see that those needs are met and that committees reflect the variety of the Anglican Church in Canada. Standing committee nominations must be submitted to the Nominating Committee on the prescribed form and must have the consent of the nominee</p>
