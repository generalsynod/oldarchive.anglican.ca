  <p>As a delegate to General Synod, it probably won&rsquo;t have escaped your attention that some of the issues that will be before you in Winnipeg are issues that were before General Synod in 2004. Among other things, this General Synod will include a discussion of same-sex blessings and the election of a new Primate. You will also be dealing with the St. Michael Report, responses to the Windsor Report, church governance, a new National Indigenous Bishop &hellip; All of these matters are potentially of interest to news media. </p>
  <p>This has implications for you as General Synod members. Reporters will be around. Reporters get in the way. Reporters may want to talk to you and may ask you questions that you are ill-prepared to answer. They may ask you questions that you don&rsquo;t <em>want </em>to answer.</p>
  <p>Reporters have a job to do. Most&nbsp; try to do their job as competently and as unobtrusively as possible. Most, but not necessarily all. Some reporters come to an event like General Synod having done their homework and with an idea of who the people are and what is going on. Some, but not all.&nbsp; All reporters work under deadline. That means that when they want something, they want it <em>now.</em> Most reporters are courteous enough not to interrupt proceedings and approach people who are otherwise occupied. Some, but not all.</p>
  <p>Since it is a virtual certainty that during this General Synod, you will interact in some way with a journalist, and since many of you (but not all) will probably have little experience dealing with the media, we thought we would provide you with some pointers.</p>
  <p>The first thing you should know is that help is available. General Synod Communications (members of General Synod staff who normally deal with the news media) have put together a team of people whose principal duties at General Synod will be to handle the media. There will be a newsroom, to which arriving reporters will be directed. Your first option, if approached by the press, could be to direct the reporter(s) to General Synod&rsquo;s media relations professionals. </p>
  <p>These people are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><em>Sam Carriere</em></strong><strong>, Director of Communications and Information Resources</strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Josie De Lucia</em></strong><strong>, assistant to the director, newsroom manager</strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Brian Sargent,</em></strong><strong> retired journalist, news releases</strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Keith Nethery, </em></strong><strong>journalist and priest; media relations</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If (or when) you are approached by reporters, here are some things for you to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul type="square">
    <li><em>You have the right to remain silent.</em> <strong>Nothing compels you speak with a reporter.      You have the right to (politely) decline to be interviewed or to answer      questions.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>If you chose to talk to a reporter, remember (and      tell them) that you are speaking as an individual. Very few people are      authorized to speak for the church.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Offer to write down your name and title for      reporters. (It&rsquo;s the only way you can be sure they will get it right.)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Answer the questions that are asked as directly      and as concisely as possible. Reporters will love you for this. Ramble and      you will see their eyes glaze over.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Remember that &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to      answer that&rdquo; is a perfectly acceptable answer.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>If you are interviewed by radio or television,      remember that you are not responsible for filling in silences. It&rsquo;s an old      trick that reporters use: at the end of an answer, just keep staring at the      subject and he/she will succumb to the temptation to please by      volunteering more and more &hellip; <strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>If you don&rsquo;t like the way an interview is going,      you have the right to end it.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li><strong>DO NOT </strong>give      a reporter a long interview and announce afterwards that it is off the      record. If you say you are off the record after the fact, reporters will      not honor that. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Don&rsquo;t violate confidences. Table Group or private      conversations are private.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Remember that all of your interview will likely      not be used. Reporters will be looking for highlights of what you said.      They may not provide context or they may provide a little bit of context.      They may provide the wrong context. Don&rsquo;t be inflammatory.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Speak for yourself. (1) <strong>Don&rsquo;t </strong>let a reporter put words in your mouth. Be      especially careful of a question that starts with something like &ldquo;So what      you are saying&hellip;&rdquo; If you agree to that, you may find yourself quoted as      having said a lot more than &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Speak for yourself. (2) Don&rsquo;t quote other people      for attribution. &ldquo;Well, my Bishop has told us that&hellip;&rdquo; is asking for big      trouble.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Speak for yourself. (3) If you are asked about      controversial topics, you will be most effective if you state your views      in a positive way rather than speak negatively about the views of others.      Don&rsquo;t worry about refuting &ldquo;them.&rdquo; Let &ldquo;them&rdquo; speak for themselves.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Remember you don&rsquo;t get to vet the content of an      interview is over. Asking to see or hear material in which you are quoted      before it is used will get you nowhere.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="square">
    <li>Most reporters are nice people. But they have      nothing invested in the story or in you as an individual. They are out to      have you say things that are interesting, enlightening, controversial, or      downright outrageous. You play into their hands at your peril.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Being interviewed can be fun. It is flattering to be asked for your views. So relax, and have fun, but be careful. And if you get into trouble, remember that help is available.</p>
  <p>Vianney (Sam) Carriere<br />
    Director, Communications and Information Resources  </p>
