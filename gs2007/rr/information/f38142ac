  </a></em><em><a href="/gs2007/rr/information/index.htm">^-- up to Information</a></em></p>
  <p>Information Dialogues will be held from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p. on Saturday, June 23 and Sunday, June 24. Locations will be posted at Synod and box lunches will be provided on both of these days. </p>
  <p>Information Dialogues provided an opportunity to hear a brief overview of the work of the Standing Committees and Councils and to provide time for questions and answers.</p>
  <h2>Saturday, June 23</h2>
  <p><strong>Communications and Information Resources</strong></p>
  <p>A brief review of work done in the past triennium and a look at priorities for the next three years. A chance to ask questions, offer suggestions and make comments on General Synod Communications.</p>
  <p><strong>Council of the North</strong></p>
  <p>Ministry in Canada&rsquo;s North is one of the most interesting and unusual
    aspects of the mission of the Anglican Church of Canada. The Council of the
    North oversees a galaxy of missions in dozens of languages from Northern
    British Columbia to the Labrador Coast and to the highest reaches of the
    Arctic. You help make this possible through your Sunday offerings. Come for
    a taste of pemmican and hear about this vital part of your own service to
    God.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Financial Management and Development</strong></p>
  <p>During a number of previous sessions, you will have reviewed the audited financial statements, you will have learned about the financial challenges and opportunities of the past triennium and you will have had conversations about the increasing emphasis required on financial development. With our ability to provide mission linked to the resources available, you may however still have questions. Accordingly, Judy Darling (A member of the Financial Management &amp; Development Committee) and Peter Blachford (The Treasurer of General Synod) invite you to join them for an informal discussion relating to the financial affairs of the Church, past, present and future.</p>
  <p><strong>Faith, Worship and Ministry - Theological Education and Formation for Ordained Ministry </strong></p>
  <p>How best might our church support the work of theological education for all the baptized and for those being equipped for ordained ministries? With attentiveness to the particular needs and contexts of theological education, what are the common expectations and aspirations that we might raise in order to nurture excellence in ministry and uphold the best of our Anglican traditions of a theologically educated church (both laity and clergy)? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Partners in Mission/Ecojustice Committees</strong></p>
  <p>This session will focus on the proposed merger of these two committees. If the merger is not approved by General Synod, then there will be a quick change of plan, and a discussion of the ongoing work of the two separate committees.</p>
  <p><strong>Anti-Racism Working Group</strong></p>
  <p>This session will give participants an opportunity to experience some of the exercises used in the Anti-Racism Training Module.</p>
  <p><strong>Pension Committee</strong></p>
  <p>A brief presentation of the work of the Pension Committee and an opportunity for questions and answers.</p>
  <h2>Sunday, June 24</h2>
  <p><strong>ABC/Augsburg (Sunday) </strong></p>
  <p>
    In the main display hall, you will have noticed a familiar, but slightly new name over the 'book tables'. Accordingly, you are invited to join Andy Seal, the Canadian Director of Augsburg Fortress Canada and Peter Blachford, the Treasurer of General Synod, for an informal chat about the new collaboration between the Anglican Church of Canada and Augsburg Fortress Canada. This is your opportunity to fully understand the background that lead to this collaboration, what has been involved during the transition period, the challenges that lie ahead and ultimately, where we hope this collaboration will lead.</p>
  <p><strong>Communications and Information Resources</strong></p>
  <p>A brief review of work done in the past triennium and a look at priorities for the next three years. A chance to ask questions, offer suggestions and make comments on General Synod Communications.</p>
  <p><strong>Council of the North</strong></p>
  <p>Ministry in Canada&rsquo;s North is one of the most interesting and unusual
    aspects of the mission of the Anglican Church of Canada. The Council of the
    North oversees a galaxy of missions in dozens of languages from Northern
    British Columbia to the Labrador Coast and to the highest reaches of the
    Arctic. You help make this possible through your Sunday offerings. Come for
    a taste of pemmican and hear about this vital part of your own service to
    God.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>Faith, Worship and Ministry</strong><strong> </strong><strong>- The Future of Liturgy and Worship</strong></p>
  <p>Faith Worship and Ministry has been engaged in thinking about the future development and revision of our authorized liturgical texts over several triennia. The authorizations of the Book of Alternative Services and Occasional Celebrations were followed, over fifteen years, by thefurther authorizationof supplemental rites and translations. The motion presented to this General Synod asks that FWM be directed over the next triennium to work on principles and processes for revision of our common worship texts. This information dialogue will provide an opportunity for conversation about what are to be the priorities for national level work on liturgy and worship, whether in terms of creation of new rites, revision, exploration of new media forms of publication, or liturgical formation of the people of God. It is an opportunity to share in imagining how best we support our life of common prayer and praise. </p>
  <p><strong>Partners in Mission/Ecojustice Committees</strong></p>
  <p>This session will focus on the proposed merger of these two committees. If the merger is not approved by General Synod, then there will be a quick change of plan, and a discussion of the ongoing work of the two separate committees.</p>
  <p><strong>Pension Committee</strong></p>
  <p>A brief presentation of the work of the Pension Committee and an opportunity for questions and answers.</p>
