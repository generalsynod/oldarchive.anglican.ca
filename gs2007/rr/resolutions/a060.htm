  <p><strong>BE IT RESOLVED:</strong></p>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Motion" -->
  <p>That Rule 16 of the Rules of Order and Procedure be amended by deleting paragraph e), re-lettering paragraphs f) to j) to be paragraphs k) to o) and adding the following new paragraphs e) to j):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>e) A member who intends to propose an amendment to a motion that is being debated may give the presiding officer written notice of such intention with the text of the intended amendment.</p>
    <p>f) When a motion or an amending motion has been made and seconded any member who has not spoken on the motion or amendment may move that the debate be closed and a vote taken on the motion or the amendment.</p>
    <p>g) The presiding officer shall not accept a motion that the debate be closed</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>i.  if any member who has given the presiding officer written notice of intention to propose an amendment has not had an opportunity to do so, or</p>
      <p>ii. if in the opinion of the presiding officer the motion that the debate be closed is an abuse of the rules or would deny members of the Synod of an adequate opportunity for discussion.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>h) When the presiding officer accepts a motion that the debate be closed that motion, when seconded, shall be decided without debate.</p>
    <p>I) A motion that the debate be closed, to be carried, requires a two-thirds majority of the Order of Bishops, and a two-thirds majority of the Orders of Clergy and Laity voting together.</p>
    <p>j) When a motion that the debate be closed is carried the presiding officer shall immediately call the question on the motion or amendment before the Synod.  When a motion that the debate be closed is lost, discussion shall continue on the motion or amendment before the Synod.</p>

  <p><strong>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong></p>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="note" -->
  <p>Following the last General Synod the Synod of the Diocese of Rupert&rsquo;s Land requested that the Rules of Order and Procedure be amended so that a motion to close debate on a motion will not prevent members who wish to propose amendments from doing so. The Handbook Concerns Committee of the Council of the General Synod reviewed the practice with respect to such motions and found that its effect varies in different forums and that it is not treated uniformly by writers on parliamentary procedure. The Council of the General Synod adopted the recommendation of the Committee that the foregoing amendment be proposed to General Synod.</p>
  <p>The effect of the amendment would guarantee that a member who gives the chair notice of intention to move an amendment will have an opportunity to do so. It would also give the chair a discretion to decline to accept a motion to close the debate if in the opinion of the chair the motion is an abuse of the rules or would deny members of the Synod of an adequate opportunity for discussion.</p>
