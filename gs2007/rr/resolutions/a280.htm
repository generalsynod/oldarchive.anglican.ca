  <p>That this General Synod:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Ask the Primate to:      </li>
  </ol>
  <ul><li>Thank dioceses and parishes for their endorsement and active participation in the PWRDF <em>Partnership for Life: For a Generation Without AIDS </em>initiative, in which $2,928,132 million dollars has been raised;
      
  </li>
    <li>Encourage them to continue raising awareness, educating, and advocating around HIV and AIDS issues.</li>
    <li>Call on Anglicans to continue to pray for and support all who are either affected or infected by HIV and AIDS and those who dedicate themselves to caring for people living with the disease.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Reaffirm The Anglican Church of Canada&rsquo;s commitment to stand in solidarity with people living with HIV and AIDS throughout the world and especially within our churches and communities.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>Ask the Primate to convey the following concerns to the Prime Minister by letter:</li>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>That Canada act on its commitment to increase access to affordable medicines for the world&rsquo;s poorest populations as part of our commitment to the universal right to health care.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>That Canada maintain its contribution to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, without taking these funds from existing commitments to international development assistance.</li>
    <li>That Canada challenge international financial institutions&rsquo; current practices demanding debt repayment and imposing structural adjustment austerity measures that limit people&rsquo;s capacity to ensure their own health and well-being.&nbsp; </li>

  <p><strong>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong></p>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="note" -->
  <p>In the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted in a historic special session of the UN General Assembly held in 2001, leaders from 189 member states committed to comprehensive, time-bound targets for the delivery of the effective HIV prevention, treatment, care and support needed to halt and begin to reverse the global epidemic by 2015.<br />
      <br />
    The UNAIDS <em>2006 Report on the global AIDS epidemic</em> acknowledges that while selected countries have reached key targets and milestones for 2005, many countries have failed to fulfill the pledges specified in the declaration and there are still significant weaknesses in the response to HIV. Nonetheless, in most countries, a strong foundation now exists on which to build an effective HIV response, with increasing political commitment and partner coordination at country level.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
    Today, there are an estimated 38.6 million people worldwide living with HIV. An estimated 4.1 million became newly infected and 2.8 million lost their lives to AIDS, says the 2006 report. Africa remains the global epicenter of the pandemic. <br />
  <br />
    The rapid spread of HIV and AIDS epidemics in Asia and Eastern Europe, illustrated by dramatic increases in new infections in China, Thailand, and Vietnam, Russia Federation and in Ukraine over the past years, poses particularly worrisome challenges for the international health community.<br />
  <br />
    Even though the global financing for AIDS has increased, funding available today only cover one third of the needs.&nbsp; National governments and international donors should significantly increase financing for AIDS by strengthening and fulfilling existing commitments, fully supporting the Global Fund and supporting innovative financing mechanisms. Equally important is to maintain and increase the flow of resources from other alternative funding sources such as NGOs.&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
  <strong><u>The Partnership For Life Initiative</u></strong></p>
  <p>Since its launch in December 2003, Anglican dioceses and parishes across Canada have enthusiastically embraced The Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF) HIV and AIDS initiative <em>Partnership for Life for a Generation Without AIDS.<br />
    </em><br />
    In 2004, the PWRDF Board allocated $1 million in bequests at year-end (March 31, 2004) to initiate the Partnership for Life work (PFL). With the support, work and prayers of Anglicans across Canada, since December 2003 to December 2005, Anglicans contributed a total of $565,398 to PFL. At the year-end March 31, 2006, the Board allocated an additional $384,600 and transferred a total of $950,000 to PFL program, which raised the total to $1,950,000. As of December 31, 2006, the total stands at $2,928,132 million.</p>
  <p>PWRDF celebrates the distinct ways in which Canadian Anglicans contribute to the Partnership for Life initiative. We celebrate the creative ways in which dioceses, parishes and individuals have employed to raise funds such as penny collections, sweater sales, canoe trips and walk-a-thons.</p>
  <p>The initiative allows Canadian Anglicans to explore HIV and AIDS issues and deepens their response to the 2004 General Synod resolutions to support international partners in their fight against the stigmatization of AIDS.</p>
  <p>The vows of our Baptismal Covenant commit us to respect the dignity of every human being, and to seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving our neighbour as ourselves.&nbsp; The stigmatization of those among us with the disease represents a clear violation of those vows. </p>
  <p>Partnership for Life funding primarily allows Canadian Anglicans through PWRDF to support global partners in their new and ongoing HIV and AIDS work. Through the heart-felt efforts of young and old, and the increased commitment of Anglicans, PWRDF partners have accomplished great things.</p>
  <p>Although the involvement of the Anglican Church and PWRDF continues to increase in breadth and depth, the AIDS pandemic continues.&nbsp; We must continue to <strong>PRAY, ACT, GIVE and LEARN</strong>. </p>
  <p>The Partnership for Life website <em><u>(<a href="https://www.partnershipforlife.ca/">www.partnershipforlife.ca</a>)</u></em> offers ongoing educational and worship resources, links and analysis for the Anglican and broader communities of faith.&nbsp;</p>
