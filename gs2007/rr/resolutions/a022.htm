  <p><strong>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong></p>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="note" -->
  <p>Under the present rules (see Appendix to this resolution) certain types of legislation require a higher level of approval than regular resolutions. </p>
  <p>Amendments to most provisions in the Declaration of Principles, and to Canons dealing with doctrine, worship or discipline, and amendments to such Canons, come into effect only when passed by a 2/3 majority of each of the three Orders of the General Synod at two successive sessions.  Between sessions they must be referred to all diocesan and provincial synods for consideration. </p>
  <p>Amendments to the three sections of the Declaration of Principles which distribute jurisdiction between the General Synod and the Provinces and which describe the General Synod&rsquo;s jurisdiction regarding discipline (section 6, 7 and 8) must also have the consent of the provinces before they are brought before the second session of the General Synod.</p>
  <p>These higher approval standards exist for at least two reasons: 1) the subject matter of such legislation is of a high level of importance and 2) legislation on these subjects affects the whole church so there should be a high level of consultation prior to enactment.</p>
  <p>Because General Synod cannot act at one session to enact this type of legislation, progress towards the accomplishment of structural and other changes can be very slow.  The Governance Working Group is of the view that this is an impediment to efficient and effective governance.  It believes that, with one exception, the requirement that these types of legislation be passed at two successive synods should be abandoned. </p>
  <p>Obviously, this would mean that the requirement for reference of such legislation to dioceses and provinces for consideration would also be abandoned.   Rather, the Governance Working Group proposes that the requirement for notice of motion be increased from 30 days to 90 days. A companion resolution to amend section 13 of the Rules of Order and Procedure will accomplish that and would give members of General Synod time to consult in their dioceses about proposed changes before they are considered by the General Synod.</p>
  <p>If a proposed change is to the jurisdiction distributing sections, provincial consent would still be required.   Such a change would not come into force until consented to.   If a provincial synod did not consider the change during the 3 years following its enactment by General Synod, it would be deemed to have consented.</p>
  <p>The one exception to this proposed change relates to matters of doctrine.  The Governance Working Group is of the view that matters of doctrine are sufficiently important that Canons dealing with them should come into effect only when passed by the required majority at two successive synods with reference between synods to dioceses and provinces.</p>
  <p>Other changes to the existing provisions have been made to improve the drafting.  They are not substantive.</p>
  <p>To come into effect, this resolution, being an amendment to the Declaration of Principles, will have to be passed by a 2/3 majority of each Order of the General Synod voting separately at two successive sessions, having been referred between those sessions to the dioceses and provinces for consideration</p>
