  <p><strong>BE IT RESOLVED:</strong></p>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Motion" -->
  <p>That this General Synod approve the merger of the Ecojustice Committee and the Partners in Mission Committee to create a new Standing Committee to be named the Partners in Mission &amp; Ecojustice Committee, effective at the beginning of the 2007 &ndash; 2010 Triennium.</p>
  <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
  <p><strong>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</strong></p>
  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="note" -->
  <p><strong>1. Understanding of Mission</strong></p>
  <p>The core mandate of the Partners in Mission Committee has been to support the mission priorities of partner churches in other parts of the world. Many of our partners have identified the impacts of global justice issues as being central to their mission work. The core mandate of the Ecojustice Committee has been to assist the Anglican Church of Canada in its mission to transform the unjust structures of society and guard the integrity of creation. There has been a growing understanding that both committees address issues that are global in scope and yet have consequences that are experienced locally, and both committees are concerned to work in respectful partnerships and to seek to build right relationships. Both committees understand their work to be about encouraging and enabling people to participate in God&rsquo;s mission to transform themselves and the world. Both committees strongly affirm that the General Synod&rsquo;s work of mission and Ecojustice needs to continue, and that it is best done in a partnership model.</p>
  <p>The Five Marks of Mission were developed by The Anglican Consultative Council between 1984 and 1990. They continue to be accepted in the Anglican Communion as a summary statement of the work of mission. The Five Marks of Mission, listed below, also summarize much of the work of the Partners in Mission and the Ecojustice Committees:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God;</li>
    <li>To teach, baptize and nurture new believers;</li>
    <li>To respond to human need by loving service;</li>
    <li>To seek to transform the unjust structures of society;</li>
    <li>To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation, and sustain and renew the life of the earth.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>2. Areas of Convergence have been identified      as follows:</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><em>Biblical and Theological Reflection</em> </p>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Reflection on the Biblical and theological       ground of our work is done by both committees.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Communication, Education and Resource Development</em> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both committees try to communicate with and educate church members across the country. </li>
    <li>Both develop appropriate resources to assist in this task.</li>
    <li>There is a need to resource and support networks of people interested and active in both areas of work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left"><em>Advocacy Around Particular Issues</em> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both committees are interested in particular issues as they emerge in particular geographical locations, and both engage in advocacy around issues.</li>
    <li>PIM tends to focus on how global issues impact the lives of partners outside of Canada, while ecojustice&rsquo;s focus also includes impacts experienced in Canada.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Relational Aspects</em> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both committees are attentive to the need to build and maintain right relationships.</li>
    <li>For PIM, the proposed merger will enhance the work of building relationships by focusing on issues experienced in Canada and in other parts of the communion, and by giving partners a common task to engage in together.</li>
    <li>For Ecojustice, the proposed merger will expand the field of partners from whom we learn and with whom we build networks.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Links with Partner Organizations</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both committees work in partnership with other organizations, some of which are common to both, such as the ACC, WCC, CCC, KAIROS, and some of which only one committee relates to, such as The Churches&rsquo; Forum for Global Ministries or Project Ploughshares.</li>
    <li>The proposed merger will provide new opportunities for working with partner organizations.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>3. Rationale re name of new committee</strong>
  <p>Both committees agreed on the importance of retaining the terms &ldquo;mission&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ecojustice&rdquo; to clearly identify the work being carried forward. They also wished to retain the term &ldquo;partners&rdquo; because of its wide use throughout the Anglican world to signal long-established and well-defined practices of relationship.</p>
  <strong>4. Practical Concern</strong>
  <p>The proposed merger is a response to current missiological thinking, and to the increasing convergence of the work of both committees. It also anticipates the direction of General Synod toward simplified structures, and the need to exercise responsible stewardship of the church&rsquo;s resources.</p>
