  <h2>1. ECCLESIASTICAL PROVINCES </h2>
  <p align="left"><strong>PROVINCE OF CANADA </strong></p>
  <p><em>Handbook<br />
  </em>This Synod memorializes the General Synod with respect to the legislation awaiting second reading as follows: &ldquo;The Synod of the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada concurs with the amendment to Canon XVII given first reading at General Synod 2004 and awaiting second reading in 2007, as printed in the Handbook of the General Synod, 14th Edition, in Appendix L, page 157.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><em>Declaration of Principles<br />
  </em>This Synod memorializes the General Synod with respect to legislation awaiting second reading as follows: &ldquo;The Synod of the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada concurs with the amendment to the Declaration of Principles given first reading at general Synod 2004, and awaiting second reading in 2007, as printed in the Handbook of the General Synod, 14th Edition, in Appendix L, page 158.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><em>Interfaith Dialogue<br />
  </em>This Synod memorializes the General Synod to emphasize the importance of Interfaith Dialogue.</p>
  <p><em>St. Michael Report</em><br />
  This Synod memorializes the General Synod to encourage the adoption of the St. Michael Report by General Synod 2007.  </p>
  <p><em>Anglican Journal</em><br />
  That this Synod send a memorial to General Synod regarding the future of the Anglican Journal and diocesan newspapers to the Council of General Synod, with copies to the National Financial Development Committee, the special task force on budgeting of the Council of General Synod, the Prioritized Operation Plan (POP) working group, and to Rob Towler, President of the Anglican Journal Board, Leanne Larmondin, Editor, Anglican Journal and Vianney Carriere, Director of Communications, Anglican Church of Canada.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We affirm the important contribution made by the Anglican Journal and diocesan papers to the life and unity of the Anglican Church of Canada.</p>
    <p>We recognize and endorse the character of the Anglican Journal as defined in its charter as a newspaper with editorial independence.</p>
    <p>Noting that these publications provide an essential service in connecting Anglicans on the local, provincial and national levels and beyond, we are concerned about their viability. Special attention must be drawn to the unique nature of diocesan media vehicles when consideration of funding cuts to the national newspaper is undertaken, with every possible effort made to ensure the continuation of operations at or close to present levels in terms of the number of issues, size of issue, maintenance of mailing grant and otherwise.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>PROVINCE OF RUPERT'S LAND </strong><br />
      <em></em><br />
      <em>St. Michael Report<br />
    </em>THAT this Provincial Synod of the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert&rsquo;s Land urges the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada to accept the conclusion of the report of the Primate&rsquo;s Theological Commission on the Blessing of Same-Sex unions (St. Michael&rsquo;s Report) that the blessing of committed same-sex unions is a matter of doctrine, and therefore must be decided at the level of General Synod.</p>
  <h2 align="left">2. DIOCESES</h2>
  <p><strong>Algoma</strong></p>
  <p><em>Same-Sex Unions</em><br />
  That this Synod of the Diocese of Algoma memorialize General Synod that the Diocese of Algoma disagrees with its affirmation of the &lsquo;sanctity of committed adult same-sex relationships' because this affirmation pre-empts the unresolved discussion of the doctrinal nature of same-sex blessings at the national level. </p>
  <p>    That the Synod of the Diocese of Algoma memorialize General Synod that: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a)  The Synod of the Diocese of Algoma assures homosexual persons that they are loved  by God and that all baptized, believing and faithful persons, regardless of  sexual  orientation, are full members of the Body of Christ; and </p>
    <p>    b)  The Synod calls on all Anglicans to minister pastorally and sensitively to all,  irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals.  (Lambeth 1998, I.10). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Brandon</strong></p>
  <p><em>General Synod 2004 &ndash; Motion A134</em><br />
    Be it Resolved that the 42nd Synod of the Diocese of Brandon send a memorial to General Synod expressing its dissatisfaction with the amendment to Motion Al34 passed at General Synod 2004 &quot;affirming the integrity and sanctity of committed adult same sex relationships &quot;, and<br />
    respectfully requesting that General Synod reconsider this matter.</p>
  <p><em>Funding for Ministry in the North</em><br />
    Be it resolved that this Synod memorialize General Synod asking it to make funding for ministry in the North an urgent priority.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Caledonia</strong></p>
  <p><strong>St. Martin&rsquo;s Anglican Church<br />
    Parish of North Peace</strong></p>
  <p><em>Blessing of Same-Sex Unions<br />
  </em>&ldquo;That we (St Martin&rsquo;s) do not support adoption of any motion at General Synod which would have at is center the church&rsquo;s recognition for the blessing of same sex marriages.&rdquo;<br />
  This vote was not found to be satisfactory to some people, so a subsequent motion was drawn up, presented, discussed, and voted upon (fifteen in favour, seven in opposition, with three abstentions):</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That this parish, recognizing the divisive nature of this topic, ask that General Synod step back from making any decision on the issue of same sex blessings at this time, to allow for further discussion, education and prayer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><strong>Fredericton</strong></p>
  <p><em>Commitment to the Wider Anglican Communion</em><br />
  That this Diocesan Synod memorialize General Synod as follows:</p>
  <p>That this Diocesan Synod of Fredericton affirms that it regards being in full and visible communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Anglican Communion throughout the world as essential and vital, and</p>
  <p>That any consideration of the Anglican Church of Canada &lsquo;walking apart&rsquo; from the rest of the Anglican Communion is unacceptable and indeed contrary to the Solemn Declaration of 1893, and would thus seriously jeopardize the relationship between this Diocese and General Synod. </p>
  <p><strong>Huron</strong></p>
  <p><em>General Synod 2004 &ndash; Act 72<br />
  </em>Be it resolved that this Synod memorialize the 2007 General Synod that the Diocese of Huron has considered the Declaration of Principles. </p>
  <p><em>This motion is in relation to Act 72, General Synod 2004 motions and namely the Amendment to the Declaration of Principles &ndash; Eligibility of Clergy, sections 3c) and 3f) vi).</em></p>
  <p><strong>Kootenay</strong></p>
  <p><em>Additions to the Calendar for the Anglican Church of Canada</em><br />
  That in the interest of providing resources for the understanding and articulation of Anglican Identity, this Synod of Kootenay memorializes General Synod to add to the Calendar for the Anglican Church of Canada:</p>

  </ul>
  <p><strong>New Westminster</strong></p>
  <p><em>Rite for Blessing Couples in Covenanted Same-Sex Union<br />
  </em>This General Synod recognizes the Diocese of New Westminster&rsquo;s engagement with issues of human sexuality, extending over many years and numerous Diocesan Synods, which has resulted in a rite for blessing couples in covenanted same-sex unions. </p>
  <p>This General Synod further acknowledges that this process has involved:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Votes at three Diocesan Synods      (1998, 2001, 2002), each with an increasing majority in favour; with the      Bishop withholding his assent until 2002;</li>
    <li>The affirmative conclusion of       a national legal consultation into the authority of a diocesan bishop to       authorize a rite of blessing of covenanted same-sex unions; </li>
    <li>A three-year program        (1998-2001) of extensive, diocese-wide parish dialogues to explore        theological issues surrounding human sexuality and to hear the stories        of gay, lesbian and ex-gay Anglicans, and to consider a proposed rite of        blessing; </li>
    <li>The careful development of a         rite for blessing couples in covenanted same-sex unions;</li>
    <li>The provision that no          individual, clergy or lay, must participate in any such rites;      </li>
    <li>The development of a           process and protocol for parishes to seek the Bishop&rsquo;s authorization           to conduct such blessings;</li>
    <li>The provision of an            episcopal visitor for parishes and individuals opposed to the            blessing of same-sex unions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This General Synod further        recognizes that the provision of this rite has enabled gay and lesbian        people to feel safe, respected, and included in the full life of the        church and that the sudden withdrawal of this rite would seriously        undermine the progress that has been made. </p>
  <p>In view of the deliberative        process leading to a rite of blessing couples in covenanted same-sex        unions in the Diocese of New Westminster, and the potentially damaging        effects if this rite is abruptly withdrawn, and given affirmation &para;12 of        the <em>St. Michael Report</em> that &ldquo;history &hellip; demonstrates that clarity emerges when thought        and action occur simultaneously,&rdquo; and notwithstanding any actions of its        2007 Synod, the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada affirms        that the present practice of authorizing and conducting such blessings        shall continue in the Diocese of New Westminster pending General Synod's        resolution of the matter.</p>
  <p><em>The St. Michael Report<br />
  </em>On behalf        of the 105th Session of the Synod of the Diocese of New Westminster,        Diocesan Council memorializes General Synod 2007 of the following        position statement concerning <em>The St. Michael Report</em>:</p>
  <p>Although a        minority continues to dissent from diocesan policy, the Synod of the        Diocese of New Westminster has acted on the understanding that its 2002        decision to permit the blessing of covenanted same-sex unions in duly        authorized requesting parishes constitutes a matter of church discipline        over which local dioceses rightly have jurisdiction. We are grateful to the Primate&rsquo;s        Theological Commission for its thoughtful consideration of whether &ldquo;the        blessing of committed same-sex unions is a matter of doctrine.&rdquo; <em>Although some find various aspects of the        Report problematic, in particular the Commission's very general        definition of &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; (e.g., </em><em>St. Michael Report, </em>&para;8), <em>we </em>are        able to affirm the following points of agreement:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>That the blessing of covenanted same-sex unions, is        &ldquo;related to the doctrines of salvation (soteriology), incarnation, the        work of the Holy Spirit (pneumatology), our creation in the image of God        (theological anthropology), sanctification, and holy matrimony&rdquo; (&para;2);</li>
    <li>That inasmuch as &ldquo;the determination of this question        will not hinder or impair our common affirmation of the historic        creeds,&rdquo; the &ldquo;blessing of same-sex unions is not a matter of core        doctrine in the sense of being credal&rdquo; (&para;10), as defined by the        Commission, but rather constitutes an        interpretation of existing doctrine;</li>
    <li>That because the blessing of same-sex unions is not a        matter of &ldquo;core&rdquo; or &ldquo;credal&rdquo; doctrine, this should not be &ldquo;a        Communion-breaking issue&rdquo; (&para;10);</li>
    <li>That &ldquo;what is required of the Church is to discern the        leading of the Spirit in this matter in reasoned and faithful dialogue        with Scripture and tradition, and then to respond in love and obedience&rdquo;        (&para;12); </li>
    <li>That in view of the continuing strong disagreements on        this issue among faithful Anglicans of differing theological persuasions        in the Anglican Church of Canada, there is an ongoing need for &ldquo;dialogue        where participants agree to pay full, careful and transparent attention        to the authority of the whole witness of Holy Scripture and its claim        upon the Church&rdquo; (&para;23);</li>
    <li>That &ldquo;history...demonstrates that clarity emerges when        thought and action occur simultaneously&rdquo; (&para;12).</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Local Option<br />
  </em>On        behalf of the 105th Session of the Synod of the Diocese of        New Westminster, Diocesan Council, while acknowledging the continuing        diversity of diocesan opinion on this matter and fully respecting the        freedom of conscience of those who dissent from Synod&rsquo;s position,        requests General Synod to affirm that the constituent dioceses of the        Anglican Church of Canada may facilitate the blessing of committed        unions of adult gay and lesbian Christians providing that:</p>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>the Synod of the        Diocese enacts a resolution requesting the Bishop to authorize such        blessings, to which he/she gives assent;<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> the resolution        indicates that such blessings shall occur in parishes only when the        incumbent and the congregation reach agreement together to request        permission of the Bishop to conduct such rites;<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li> the resolution        indicates that no member of the Diocese, whether lay or ordained, shall        be required to act against their conscience in the blessing of such        unions or be subject to any form of discrimination for his/her personal        position on the issue; and<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>the        resolution indicates that where requested, supplementary episcopal        oversight of dissenting congregations shall be conducted according to        the terms of &quot;Shared Episcopal Ministry,&quot; or any other scheme        officially authorized by the House of Bishops of the Anglican Church of        Canada.</li>

  <p><strong></strong><em>Blessing of Same Gender Unions<br />
  </em>Whereas:<strong> </strong>The blessing of same gender unions and the full integration <br />
    of the gay        and lesbian community into the parishes of the Diocese of Niagara and the Anglican Church of Canada        have been topics of discussion and dissension for the last thirty years<br />
    <br />
  And        Whereas:<strong> </strong>The 130th Synod of the Diocese of Niagara        voted 67% in favour of asking the Bishop to &ldquo;grant clergy permission to        exercise their discretion in blessing the relationships of gay or        lesbian couples who have been married civilly, once they with their        congregations have petitioned the Bishop for permission to be a        &ldquo;blessing community&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And        Whereas:<strong> </strong>The 37th Session of General Synod        (2004) passed a motion that &ldquo;affirmed the integrity and sanctity of        committed adult same sex relationships&rdquo; </p>
  <p>And        Whereas:<strong> </strong>Several Youth Synods of the Diocese of        Niagara have passed motions with overwhelming support that affirm the        full integration of gays and lesbians into our parishes and the blessing        of the same gender unions</p>
  <p>And        Whereas:<strong> </strong>The 37th Session of General Synod        (2004) deferred consideration of a motion affirming the authority of        diocesan synods to authorize the blessing of committed same sex unions        until the 38th Session of General Synod (2007), June 19 &ndash; 25,        2007</p>
  <p>Be it        resolved that:<strong></strong></p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>Youth Synod 2006 affirms that the blessing of             the unions of committed same sex partners is both just and             righteous, and that to withhold this blessing is to continue             discrimination against gays and lesbians as well as perpetuating             the brokenness of the community of Christ Jesus. </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>A memorial is to be sent to the 133rd             Session of Diocesan Synod affirming the support of Youth Synod 2006             for the Bishop to &ldquo;grant clergy permission to exercise their             discretion in blessing the relationships of gay or lesbian couples             who have been married civilly, once they with their congregations             have petitioned the Bishop for permission to be a &ldquo;blessing             community&rdquo;.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
                              
    <li>A memorial is to be sent to the 133rd             Session of Diocesan Synod recommending that a vote be allowed on             the matter of the blessing of the unions of committed adult same             sex partners so that the work of the Holy Spirit as reflected in             the mind of the Diocese of Niagara can be made clear to the 38th             Session of General Synod.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="4" type="1">
    <li>A statement is issued to the Niagara Anglican             by Youth Synod Council on behalf of Youth Synod 2006 encouraging             parishes to engage in respectful, civil dialogue about the issue of             blessing same gender unions before the 133rd Session of             Diocesan Synod on November 25, 2006 so that delegates do not impede             discussion or motions on the grounds that their parish has not             discussed the issue.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
                              
    <li>A memorial is sent to the 38th             Session of General Synod affirming the support of Youth Synod 2006             of the Diocese of Niagara for authorizing the &ldquo;local option&rsquo; at the             diocesan level for the blessing of the unions of committed adult             same sex partners.</li>

  Be it resolved that this        Diocesan Synod memorialize General Synod as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>That        this Diocesan Synod affirms and upholds the continuing authority of the        Solemn Declaration of 1893 as the charter document of the Anglican        Church of Canada;<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>That        this Diocesan Synod objects, along with our two Bishops, to the        consecration of Gene        Robinson as a bishop in the Episcopal Church of the United States        of America (ECUSA);</li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="3">
    <li>That        this Diocesan Synod regards any decision by the General Synod of the        Anglican Church of Canada, with respect to the endorsement of the        blessing of same-sex unions, which would jeopardize our full and visible        communion with the Anglican Communion throughout the world as deplorable,        and seriously affecting the relationship between this Diocese and        General Synod.  </li>

  <p><em>St. Michael Report</em><br />
  That this Synod of the        Diocese of Rupert&rsquo;s Land urge the General Synod of the Anglican Church        of Canada to accept the conclusion of the Report of the Primate&rsquo;s        Theological Commission (The St. Michael Report) that the blessing of        committed same-sex unions is a matter of doctrine, and further we        recommend that this be decided at the level of General Synod.</p>
  <p>That this Synod of the        Diocese of Rupert&rsquo;s Land urge the General Synod of the Anglican Church        of Canada to support the concept of an Anglican covenant and commit the        Anglican Church of Canada to working with Anglicans throughout the world        in its drafting, within the belief standards of the Lambeth        Quadrilateral and the Solemn Declaration of the Canadian Church of 1893.</p>
