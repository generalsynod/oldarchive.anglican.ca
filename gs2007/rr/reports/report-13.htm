  <p><strong>Ecumenical Partner: </strong></p>
  <p>Sandra Beardsall (UCC Partner) </p>
  <p>The members of the Joint Commission have met on eleven occasions since the ratification of the Waterloo Declaration of full communion between our two churches in July 2001. We have met on at least one occasion on the territory of each of the four ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada and the five synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. These meetings have provided us with many opportunities to meet and worship with the people of our two churches: clergy, laity, faculty of our theological colleges, and denominational staff from each of our churches. We have had many first hand experiences of Full Communion as it has been lived out within our shared life. </p>
  <p>In fulfilling its mandate to coordinate the implementation of the Waterloo Declaration, the Joint Commission continues to frame and review its work in light of the nine commitments of the Declaration and identifying areas where those commitments may have specific implications for our shared life and ministry. </p>
  <p><strong><em>Commitment 1:</em></strong> to welcome persons ordained in either of our churches to the office of bishop, priest/pastor or deacon to serve, by invitation and in accordance with any regulations which may from time to time be in force, in that ministry in the receiving church without re-ordination.</p>
  <p>Action items identified by the Joint Commission:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Articulating protocols for clergy serving in one      another&rsquo;s churches</li>
    <li>Addressing shared ministry issues</li>
    <li>Addressing common discipline issues</li>
    <li>Determining eligibility for electoral processes      in one another&rsquo;s churches</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Work accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepared a document entitled <em>Guidelines for Anglican and Lutheran Priests and Pastors Serving Appointments in Each Other&rsquo;s Churches</em>. The Guidelines were reviewed by the Joint Meeting of Bishops. The ELCIC National Church Council and the Anglican Council of General Synod have now approved these guidelines and made them available for general use.</li>
    <li>Sought ways to learn from the experiences of congregations that already serve in shared or collaborative ministries. <em>Guidelines for Collaborative Ministries</em> have been prepared to govern such shared ministry relationships.</li>
    <li>A Shared Ministries Task Force has been established by the ACC, ELCIC, United Church of Canada and the Presbyterian Church in Canada.</li>
    <li>An Ecumenical Shared Ministries Handbook is being developed by the task force. The Joint Commission contributed to the development of the Handbook.</li>
    <li>Each church has been asked to find a way within its legal system to create a category of &lsquo;ecumenical shared ministries&rsquo; in which particular policies can apply that are not necessarily the same as for regular congregations. </li>
    <li>Shared Ministries have been discussed by the Joint Meeting of Bishops.</li>
    <li>Discipline issues are addressed in the Clergy Guidelines.</li>
    <li>Served as a body of advice to a bishop in one instance affecting both churches.</li>
    <li>Requested that our      churches make the necessary constitutional and canonical changes to allow:      a) for Anglican and Lutheran clergy serving in a congregation of the other      church to be eligible for the same rights, responsibilities and privileges      of clergy serving similar charges in their originating church, and b) to      provide for parity in the eligibility of clergy for election to the office      of bishop in either church. This work is progressing through due process      in our respective bodies.</li>
    <li>Requested that the      respective churches consider adopting interim measures to make such      participation possible until constitutional and canonical changes have      been made.</li>
    <li>ELCIC has made      provision in its documents at both the national and synodical level to      recognize full communion partners as eligible to serve on committees and      relevant church bodies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Suggestions for future work:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Review Clergy      Guidelines to ensure that they match practice.</li>
    <li>Continue to monitor and review the work of the Ecumenical Shared Ministries Task Force and review the Collaborative Ministry Guidelines for effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Develop guidelines for establishing new joint congregations.</li>
    <li>Remind bishops that      the expertise of the Commission is available in situations that affect      both churches.</li>
    <li>Ensure that processes for establishing eligibility for election and service in each other&rsquo;s churches are established at all levels.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Commitment 2:</strong></em> to invite one another&rsquo;s bishops to participate in the laying on of hands at the ordination of bishops as a sign of the unity and continuity of the Church, and to invite pastors and priests to participate in the laying on of hands at the ordination of pastors or priests in each other&rsquo;s churches:</p>
  <p>Action items identified by the Joint Commission:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Ensuring that invitations are issued in a timely      and effective manner; publicizing the fact of such participation as      effectively as possible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Work accomplished:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Noted the high levels      of shared participation in episcopal ordinations. To the best of our knowledge, all      bishops ordained in our churches since July 2001 have been ordained with      the participation and laying-on-of-hands by bishops of both churches.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Suggestions for future work:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Remind diocesan and      synodical bodies to invite full communion partners to participate in the      ordination of presbyters and the ordination/consecration of      deacons/diaconal ministers.      The Commission further recommends that this commitment be extended      to include the installation of pastors and celebrations of new ministries.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em><strong>Commitment 3:</strong></em> to consult with one another regarding developments in our understanding of the ministry of all the baptized, including the ordained ministry</p>
  <p>Action items identified by the Joint Commission:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Engaging in shared studies and reflections      concerning ordered ministries</li>
    <li>Exploring the development of alternate forms of      lay and ordained ministry</li>
    <li>Establishing a joint task group on confirmation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Work accomplished:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Received documents on lay ministry formation from      the ELCIC.</li>
    <li>Anglican participant serving on Program Committee      for Leadership for Ministry, and Lutheran participant serving on Faith,      Worship and Ministry</li>
    <li>Models of &lsquo;mutual&rsquo; or      &lsquo;total&rsquo; ministry being considered by Anglican churches have been discussed      at the Commission, but not in much detail. It was recognized that Anglicans and Lutherans are both      struggling to provide ministry in remote areas; Anglicans tend to put a      greater value on sacramental presidency while Lutherans tend to put a      greater value on theological education and formation for preaching. This can result in different      approaches, which can then lead to tensions between our churches. Continuing dialogue is critical.</li>
    <li>Established a joint task force to undertake a      study of the theology and practice of confirmation in our two      churches. It conducted a      survey of understanding and practice and will bring questions to the two      churches</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Suggestions for future work:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Remind churches that, on important issues      affecting the life of both our churches, consultation needs to happen      early in the process.</li>
    <li>Continue work on how to provide effective ministry      in accordance with our theology and polity, and try to find solutions      together.</li>
    <li>The Lutheran participant on Faith, Worship and      Ministry needs a solid connection with theological education in the ELCIC.</li>
    <li>Continue work on forms of baptismal renewal, including      confirmation, reception of new members, and affirmation of baptism.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong><em>Commitment 4:</em></strong><strong> </strong>to <strong></strong>work towards a common understanding of diaconal ministry<strong></strong></p>
  <p>Action items identified by the Joint Commission:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Reviewing present      status of diaconal ministry in our churches</li>
    <li>Developing shared      standards for theological education and formation</li>
    <li>Engaging in      consultation with ACC and ELCIC diaconal ministers</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Work accomplished:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Engaged the bishops of      our churches in conversation regarding the diaconate on two occasions.</li>
    <li>Prepared a comparison      of the rites of ordination and consecration in the two churches and      identified significant areas of congruence.</li>
    <li>Surveyed      deacons/diaconal ministers in the two churches regarding their call to,      preparation for and experiences of diaconal ministry; a report arising      from this survey was presented to the Fall 2006 joint meeting of the bishops      of the two churches.</li>

  <h4>In Conclusion</h4>
  
  <p>The members of the Joint Commission are deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve the shared life of our respective churches through the work of this commission.</p>
  <p>In July 2001 our churches took a bold and decisive and step toward advancing the common mission in which we have been called to serve. Significant and decisive steps have been taken since that time. In November 2006 a number of events were held across the country in thanksgiving for five years of Full Communion. During the ACC General Synod and the ELCIC National Convention in June of 2007 in Winnipeg, both churches will come together for a joint day of worship and study celebrating six years of Full Communion.</p>
  <p>We note, however, that a great deal more remains to be accomplished. As such, we recommend that:</p>
  <ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>A new Joint Commission      be constituted for a six year term to seek greater fulfillment of the      mandate first given to us in 2001, specifically, &ldquo;<strong><em>to nurture our      growth in communion, to coordinate the implementation of this Declaration,      and report to the decision-making bodies of both our churches.&rdquo;</em></strong></li>
    <li>That our respective      churches commit themselves to engaging a more ambitious agenda toward      implementation of the Waterloo Declaration.</li>
    <li>That this report and      its suggestions for future work be commended to the next Joint Commission      for their consideration and action.    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>&ldquo;We rejoice in our Declaration as an expression of the visible unity of our churches in the one Body of Christ. We are ready to be co-workers with God in whatever tasks of mission serve the Gospel. We give glory to God for the gift of unity already ours in Christ, and we pray for the fuller realization of this gift in the entire Church.&rdquo;     </p>
