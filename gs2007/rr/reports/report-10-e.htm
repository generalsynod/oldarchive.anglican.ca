  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
  <p>1a.&nbsp; It is appropriate for Anglican bishops, when invited, to participate in episcopal ordinations or consecrations in churches with which their own churches are in communion, including the laying on of hands.&nbsp; Within this ecclesial context, the laying on of hands is an indication of the intent to confer holy orders, and a sign of the communion that we share. </p>
  <p>1b.&nbsp; Anglican bishops should refrain from participating in the laying on of hands at the ordination or consecration of a bishop for a church with which their own church is not in communion.&nbsp; Ordination is always an act of God in and through the church, which from the Anglican perspective means that bishops are representative ministers of their own churches.&nbsp; Ordination is not the individual act of bishops in their own persons. </p>
  <p>1c.&nbsp; Similarly, bishops from other churches not in communion should not take part in the laying on of hands at the ordination or consecration of Anglican bishops, for the collegial and sacramental sign of the laying on the hands by bishops belongs within the context of ecclesial communion.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>1d.&nbsp; Anglicans welcome the participation of bishops from other churches in the Liturgy of the Word and elsewhere in celebrations of episcopal ordination or consecration.&nbsp; Their very presence and prayers are valued ecumenical signs, even when the present state of ecclesial relations does not permit the interchangeability of sacramental ministries.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>2a.&nbsp; It is appropriate for Anglican priests, when invited, to participate in ordinations of presbyters in churches with which their church is in communion, including the laying on of hands.&nbsp; Such acts are a sign of the communion that we share.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>2b. Anglican priests should not take part in the laying on of hands in the ordinations of ministers of word and sacrament in churches with which their own church is not in communion, because such an act belongs within the context of ecclesial communion</p>
  <p>2c.&nbsp; Similarly, ministers from churches not in communion should not take part in the laying on of hands at the ordination of Anglican priests, because this too belongs within the context of ecclesial communion.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>2d.&nbsp; Anglicans welcome the participation of presbyters and other ministers of word and sacrament from other churches in the Liturgy of the Word and elsewhere in celebrations of priestly ordination.&nbsp; The very presence and prayers of such ministers are valued ecumenical signs, even when the present state of ecclesial relations does not permit the interchangeability of sacramental ministries.<strong></strong></p>
