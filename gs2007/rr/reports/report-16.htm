  <p>The Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF) is the Canadian Anglican agency for development, relief, refugees and justice. </p>
  <h1>1. VALUES</h1>
  <p>The Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF) undertakes development, relief and refugee work through partnership. Partnership-centred development is theologically based on the Isaiah 65 prophecy that God&rsquo;s people will build homes and live in them, grow food and eat it, bear children and see them into their old-age. Partnership is also based on the Easter message that draws us into the work of fulfilling the prophecy of God&rsquo;s justice. </p>
  <p>PWRDF deeply values learning as a way to strengthen its ministry and partnership relationships. The strategic plan for 2007-2010 intentionally details the intent of a learning organisation and a set of objectives for that period. </p>
  <p>Key lessons 2004-2007 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>As a result of the Tsunami that hit the coasts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and other countries near the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004 and the generous response of faithful Anglicans, PWRDF identified the need for a renewed emergency response plan for major humanitarian disasters and more concerted cross-training within the Finance staff team. The emergency response plan, revised in 2005, requires significant collaboration across all three PWRDF staff teams drawing on the Emergencies Program Officer, Executive Director, Communications Coordinator, Web Tender, and Donor Relations Officer for initial steps. </li>
    <li>As a result of Canadian Anglicans interest in more and deeper connection with PWRDF ministry we have experimented with a number of ways to strengthen the connections between and amongst all the people of PWRDF. We celebrate the interest of Canadian Anglicans to more deeply connect with PWRDF&rsquo;s ministry and the positive impact that deeper connection with partnership-driven development has on peoples&rsquo; faith journeys and understanding of development and partnership. We recognise as well that some ways of connecting are not possible due to their strain on the development partner organisation or the strain on staffing resources. We are in discussions about providing new ways for connecting with PWRDF ministries that are within our resources and which would be subject to evaluation for future learning.</li>
    <li>Sadly, as a result of the Church of Uganda&rsquo;s decision to end its partnership with PWRDF due to the conflict in the Anglican Communion, PWRDF has identified the need for addressing conflict, communication guidelines, and ending of partnerships (initiated by the partner organisation) in its partnership policy.  </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>2. THE PEOPLE OF PWRDF</h1>
  <h2>The Anglican Church of Canada</h2>
  <p>PWRDF is thankful for a close working relationship with our Primate particularly in response to emergencies and human rights advocacy. PWRDF gives thanks for the contributions of the over one million Canadian Anglicans to its ministry. PWRDF parish and Diocesan programs continue to be innovative across the country. The upcoming Diocesan Forum will provide an opportunity for sharing of &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;. PWRDF is thankful to the individuals who give gifts, as well as the parishioners who contribute through their parish and Diocese to the Anglican ministry of PWRDF. </p>
  <p>PWRDF participates in the General Synod and the Council of the General Synod with a voice but not a vote. A Board member is appointed to the three-year term as representative to CoGS. The Executive Director is a member of the Management Team of Church House. PWRDF occasionally addresses the House of Bishops on issues of common concern. </p>
  <p>Within Church House we deeply value opportunities for collaborative work with colleagues in Eco-Justice, Indigenous Ministries, Partners in Mission, and the communications group. Cooperative work with Planned Giving and stewardship staff at Church House and Diocesan planned giving officers is particularly valuable to PWRDF financial development success. </p>
  <p>PWRDF Diocesan Voting Representative are appointed by their Bishop with the key function of strengthening PWRDF &ndash; Diocesan partnerships and relationships through mutual accountability, transparency and participation in governance. </p>
  <p>PWRDF Diocesan Coordinators are recruited and appointed by their diocese with the key function to develop and support opportunities for a PWRDF diocesan partnership program including education, networking, prayer/worship, fundraising and social action. </p>
  <h2>Development Partners </h2>
  <p>A current snapshot of PWRDF&rsquo;s development work would show 75 country specific partners and 25 regional partners in 4 regions &ndash; Africa, Asia/Pacific, Canada and Latin America/Caribbean, focussing on a variety of sustainable development programming such as micro-credit, food security, health and human rights which are directly benefiting people in the communities. </p>
  <h2>Board of Directors</h2>
  <p>As per the by-law of the organisation, the Board of Directors is comprised of a bishop, members of clergy and laity through Diocesan representation and a Youth Council representative, Partner Representatives from international development partner organisations, Indigenous development partner organisations and a representative from the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples, as well as ex-officio members.

  <h1>3. PROGRAMME AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
  <h2>Strategic plan</h2>
  <p>The PWRDF Board of Directors and staff team are responsible for developing an organisational strategic plan and implementation plan. The current strategic plan is for 2004-2007. The strategic themes for this decade are intricately connected as we seek to build sustainable, resilient and just communities:</p>
  <p><em>Weaving a Culture of Peace with Justice</em> &ndash; together with partners, we advance peace with justice, human rights and democracy in the Global South and North.</p>
  <p><em>Building a Moral Economy</em> &ndash; by advancing people-centred, equitable and ecologically sustainable political economies in the Global South and North.</p>
  <p><em>Accompanying Communities in Crisis </em>&ndash; by saving and protecting lives, enhancing recovery and improving the quality of life of communities in crisis impacted by natural and/or human disasters.</p>
  <h2>Public Engagement</h2>
  <p>Through the Public Engagement staff team, PWRDF is responsible for finding ways to engage and empower Canadian Anglicans to act, give and pray in support of its work. </p>
  <p>Annual educational resources are available every fall for use in parish programming. Since 2004 the themes have been: Weaving a Culture of Peace &ndash; with Reconciliation (2004), Enough for All - Water (2005), Enough for All &ndash; Development (2006), Enough for All &ndash; Care for Creation (2007). The annual cycle of publications include: quarterly production of the newsletter Under the Sun and Pew Bulletin Stories distributed to over 2000 people, a monthly email update to a list of over 800 recipients. The annual report, for the second year, is in a new narrative and photo format. It allows us to better tell the PWRDF story and you have said that you like it. The PWRDF website <a href="http://www.pwrdf.org/">www.pwrdf.org</a> continues to be a vibrant place for telling the stories of partners&rsquo; work and awareness-raising resources for use in families and parishes. </p>
  <h2>Development, Relief and Refugees</h2>
  <p>Through the Development staff team PWRDF is responsible for the development, relief response, and international refugee program. Coordinators are responsible for the development program and partnerships in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Indigenous Peoples (Canada), and Latin America-Caribbean. PWRDF has participated in a successful ecumenical collaboration that since the response to the December 2005 Tsunami has continue to strengthen its ecumenical emergencies partnership. The Refugee Network, supported by a Development staff team member. </p>
  <h2>Finance</h2>
  <p>The Finance Team is responsible for the day-to-day financial management and administration of the development, relief, refugee and justice programs including grants management, donor relations, systems management. The team supports financial development initiatives. PWRDF maintains a ratio of less than 10% budget allocation for administration. </p>
  <h2>Special Initiatives</h2>
  <p>Partnership for Life, the PWRDF HIV and AIDS Initiative, raised over $2 million towards new HIV and AIDS programming, raised awareness within Canada about the stigma of AIDS and advocated for access to necessary pharmaceuticals. (See the resolution on Partnership for Life for more details or visit the PWRDF website <a href="http://www.pwrdf.org/">www.pwrdf.org</a>.) <br />
   <br />
    PWRDF has revitalised its Youth Initiative. Pod casts, renewed resources, youth internships, a youth initiative website <a href="http://www.justgeneration.ca/">www.justgeneration.ca</a> all speak to this celebrated renewal. </p>
  <p>A consultant is working with PWRDF on a financial development strategy, a particularly important undertaking as we approach our 50th anniversary and make plans for the next 50 years. </p>
  <h1>4. Other relationships that keep the work of PWRDF strong</h1>
  <p>PWRDF collaborates ecumenically for such purposes as joint delegations or strengthening advocacy initiatives, or as noted above for strengthening emergency relief response. </p>
  <p>PWRDF, together with the Mennonites, Presbyterians, and United Church (PUMA) sought matching funds from the Government of Canada to strengthen responses for relief and recovery to communities in Tamil Nadu state of India hardest hit by the Tsunami in December 2004. This ecumenical partnership worked so well that in October 2005 when the earthquake devastated communities in Pakistan and India, PUMA was joined by the Pentecostals, Christian Reformed and Canadian Lutheran Churches to coordinate response and seek matching funds from the Government of Canada. </p>
  <p>KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives is a key ecumenical partner for educational resource production, advocacy coordination, and some joint development work. We participate in KAIROS through financial support, membership on its Board of Directors, committees and working groups. KAIROS has proposed a change to its program committee structure in response to a consultation with member churches. Over the last three years PWRDF has participated in such KAIROS-initiated activities as the Water Campaign and corporate social responsibility actions. <br />
   <br />
    PWRDF is a member of the Canadian Council of Churches &ndash; Canadian Ecumenical Anti-Racism Network and thus is involved in resource creation and action plans related to racial justice and denominational observances of the International Day for the Elimination of Racism (March 21).<br />
   <br />
    The Student Christian Movement &ndash; Canada participates in the PWRDF Youth Council. Through the SCM several members of the PWRDF Youth Council participated in a recent pilgrimage to the School of the Americas. </p>
  <p>The World Council of Churches, in autumn 2006, recognised PWRDF as a specialised ministry. As such, PWRDF is invited to participate in round table meetings. <br />
   <br />
    PWRDF coordinates most of its relief and recovery work through the coordinated efforts of ACT International, a global ecumenical response to global disasters and emergencies. ACT stands for Action by Churches Together. <br />
   <br />
    A new global ecumenical body has emerged from discussions at the World Council of Churches. PWRDF is a full member of ACT Development. The intention is that ACT Development will strengthen churches development efforts globally. </p>
  <p>Additionally there are numerous secular organisations with whom we collaborate on common issues of concern, such as Mining Watch and the Interagency Coalition on AIDS and Development. </p>
  <p>Of particular note, is PWRDF&rsquo;s relationship with the Canadian Council for International Cooperation (CCIC) with whom we work on advocacy campaigns, share best practices, and participate in round-tables and leadership forums with government and political officials. Over the last three years PWRDF has participated in such CCIC-sponsored activities as the Public Engagement Forum focussed on Collaboration for Change.</p>
  <p>PWRDF also has a funding relationship with the Manitoba Council for International Cooperation (MCIC) and the Saskatchewan Council for International Cooperation (SCIC). </p>
  <p>For well over a decade, PWRDF has been in a multi-year core program funding relationship with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). Compliance requirements include regular external audits, external program evaluations as well as quarterly narrative and cash-flow financial reporting. The Canadian Partnerships Branch of CIDA, through whom PWRDF receives its CIDA funding, is in the midst of significant administrative transition regarding its proposal-making process. This current transition is preceded by significant changes in financial reporting brought into effect in 2005. PWRDF has made all the necessary adjustments to keep up with CIDA&rsquo;s changing compliance requirements.  </p>
  <h1>5. CHALLENGES</h1>
  <p>The current tensions within the Anglican Communion are a challenge to some PWRDF partnership relationships. <br />
   <br />
    Changing compliance requirements from CIDA and changing pressures on CIDA from federal government are a strain on some partners. </p>
  <h1>6. CELEBRATIONS </h1>
  <p>We celebrate the ministries of Canadian Anglicans who keep PWRDF a vital part of our baptismal expression and the presence of The Anglican Church of Canada in the world responding to development and refugee needs and emergencies. We celebrate the gifts of the many who participate in direct ways in PWRDF ministries of development, relief, refugees and justice, particularly partners engaged in sustainable development, Canadian Anglicans who act, give and pray in support of PWRDF ministries, the skilled and passionate staff team and the wise counsel and leadership of the Board of Directors. </p>
  <p>We look forward to celebrating with you the 50th anniversary of PWRDF&rsquo;s ministries in 2009.</p>
  <h1>7. Follow up from General Synod 2004</h1>
  <p>We have followed up on the resolutions from GS 2004 related to Colombia, Cuba, HIV and AIDS, Sanctuary, Just Peace&hellip;.True Security, Globalization and Free Trade, Refugees and Immigrants, Sudan, and the 0.7% Development Goal. </p>
