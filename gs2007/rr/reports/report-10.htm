  <p>To the Most Reverend Andrew Hutchison, Primate, and Members of General Synod.</p>
  <p><strong>I. OVERVIEW</strong> </p>
  <p>The role of Faith, Worship and Ministry (FWM) is to help Canadian Anglicans live out their Christian faith thoughtfully, prayerfully and with commitment through liturgical development and theological education, to foster inter-church and inter-faith dialogues, to promote theological reflection and to provide resources on issues of doctrine, ethics, ecumenism, evangelism and mission.</p>
  <p> The Mandate, as listed in the Handbook of General Synod requires FWM to:</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Articulate standards and develop resources for worship and liturgy.</li>
    <li>Foster and facilitate collaboration between Canadian theological colleges, and with the national church.</li>
    <li>Develop policy for, monitor, and engage in inter-church dialogues.</li>
    <li>Develop policy for, monitor and engage in inter-faith dialogues</li>
    <li>Promote theological reflection, and provide resources and education on issues of doctrine, ethics, ministry, ecumenism, leadership, evangelism and mission</li>
    <li>Monitor work of the Anglican Communion in the areas of liturgy, doctrine, authority and identity.</li>
    <li>Monitor work of the World Council of Churches and the Canadian Council of Churches in areas of faith and order, ethics, theological education, and inter-faith relations.</li>
    <li>Convene gatherings and develop networks related to the work of the Committee</li>
    <li>Work alongside the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples around aboriginal spirituality.</li>
    <li>Work with the House of Bishops to define doctrine where necessary.</li>
    <li>Use the Lund principle to work ecumenically wherever possible.</li>
    <li>Report to the Council of General Synod.</li>
    <li>Encourage theological reflection on stewardship and on the Committee&rsquo;s mandate</li>
    <li>Within the Committee&rsquo;s mandate, do functional strategic planning and visioning</li>
    <li>Maintain liaison with the House of Bishops</li>
    <li>When deemed appropriate, invite partners (international, ecumenical, or internal) to join the committee.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> Over the past triennium, FWM has engaged in almost all of the above, to the extent that it could, given the time and cost restraints and the priority issues given to the Committee.<br />
   <br />
   FWM was also conscious to keep the General Synod Framework and Letting Down the Nets in view so that its ongoing tasks as well as strategic planning were consistent with them.</p>
  <p> Given its large and demanding mandate, FWM endeavored to practice good stewardship of time and resources by breaking its work down into three task groups, Anglican Identity and Relationships (AR), Ethics and Inter-Faith Relations (EI) and Ministry, Worship and Theological Education (MWTh). The meetings of FWM contained significant blocks of time wherein the task groups could do their own work.</p>
  <p> In carrying out its mandate, FWM developed priorities based on the following:</p>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>Matters referred to the Committee by meetings of the General Synod</li>
    <li>Matters referred to the Committee by the Council of General Synod</li>
    <li>Matters referred to the Committee by other General Synod bodies</li>
    <li>On going work begun by previous FWM Committees</li>
    <li>Reflection on its over all mandate and the Framework</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p> Members of Synod are urged to review the FWM section on the National Church&rsquo;s Website. It contains much valuable information over and above the limited nature of this written report, and it gives a good idea of the scope of the work of FWM.</p>
  <p> FWM is very much a national committee and endeavors to take a national view of the many matters that lie at the heart of our church. These include its faith, doctrines, liturgies, ways of helping congregations carry out ministry, relationships with other Christian traditions and faith groups, ethics and theological training. Being a national committee requires that voices from different parts of this large country be heard, as well as voices from First Nations, youth, the Military Ordinariate and our Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada full communion partner.</p>
  <p> The full committee met six times during the triennium, two times each year. Meetings were held mostly in the Toronto Area. However one meeting was held near Quebec City and another at the Sorrento Centre in British Columbia. This enabled FWM to have face to face interchanges with the local church, which enhanced in important ways our sense of how the work we do is played out in different parts of our church.</p>
  <p> Members of the Committee also try to attend Sunday liturgy in a local parish, if possible. During the triennium we were able to worship at two ELCIC parishes, (Holy Cross, in Burlington, and Church of the Advent, North York), St. Mary, a joint Anglican-United Church charge in Sorrento and the Paroisse Tous les Saints at the Cathedral in Quebec City.</p>
  <p> Daily worship was usually led by members of the different task groups, though if at one of the convents we sometimes joined the worship offered by the sisters. Daily worship offers members of the committee a chance to explore some of the different worship resources that are available.</p>
  <p> FWM is indeed grateful to those who hosted us: St. Michael&rsquo;s Convent of the Sisters of the Church in Oakville, the Convent of the Sisters of St. John the Divine in Toronto, the Sorrento Centre in British Columbia and the Centre de Spiritualit&eacute; in Loretteville, Quebec.</p>
  <p> The work of FWM over the past triennium was dominated by the St. Michael Report and the Windsor Report, as well as consideration of meetings of the Primates and of the Anglican Consultative Council. With regard to the latter, FWM was grateful for a briefing by the Prolocutor, Dean Peter Elliott, who along with Canon Allan Box of Ottawa and our own FWM member Maria Highway helped make the Canadian presentation at the ACC. CoGS and others asked for our reflection on the important issues with which the Canadian Church and the Anglican Communion are wrestling.</p>
  <p> The last meeting of General Synod sent motions regarding Theological Education to FWM. In order to deal with the matter substantively, an optional extra day was added on to one of our meetings, and many members over and above the MWTh task group attended. In addition, work in the priority of Congregational Development was referred to FWM. Again, an optional extra day was added on to a regular meeting and many members of the full committee attended. FWM was also asked to devote the better part of a day to Anti-racism training, which turned out to be of great value.</p>

  <p><strong>III. MATTERS REFERRED BY THE MEETING OF GENERAL SYNOD</strong></p>
  <p>Note: General Synod 2004 Act numbers are given.</p>
  <p><u>1. Theological Education</u></p>
  
  <p>(General Synod Act 76). FWM was asked,  in cooperation with the House of Bishops, to undertake a study of educational  standards for those training for ordered ministry. Specifically, such a study  would include a review of the Task Force for Theological Education for  Ordained Ministry, 2001 (&ldquo;The Bays Report&rdquo;); an assessment of the means for  implementation of core expectations/national standards; an assessment of the  implications of the agreement of full communion with the ELCIC for Anglican  theological education, and to examine the respective roles of theological  colleges and the wider church in practical and immediate post-ordination  training.</p>
  <p>As noted, FWM as a  whole added a significant block of time to study the matter of theological  education. In addition, the MWTh task group undertook a number of initiatives  in response to this Act, consulting widely, including with the annual meeting  of Heads of Anglican Colleges, the Ontario Provincial Commission on  Theological Education, and with appropriate ELCIC bodies. They collected and  reviewed diocesan expectations and standards for candidacy and theological  education for ordained ministries, and studied national canons and standards  documents from other Provinces of the Anglican Communion, liaising with TEAC  and other international and ecumenical partners. </p>
  <p>The MWTh task group  proposed consultations with the House of Bishops. The link bishop (Michael  Bedford-Jones) facilitated conversations in the full house and conversations  were held in each of the four Provincial Houses of Bishops and finally in the  national house together with the ELCIC bishops. The latter meeting has recommended  that:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Council of  General Synod convene a national gathering on theological education in Canada,  under the auspices of the Faith, Worship and Ministry Committee, in order to:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Develop a strategic plan for the future needs for ordained  ministry in the Anglican Church of Canada;</li>
      <li>Make recommendations to the Church about the strategic use of  resources to support theological education;</li>
      <li>Review the current patterns of preparation for ordained  ministry in the Anglican Church of Canada and make recommendations for their  effective use;</li>
      <li>Develop common standards for theological t raining including  core curricula, evaluation, field t raining, selection, support and  recruitment of candidates, and core standards for spiritual and emotional  readiness for ordination;</li>
      <li>That such a national gathering be held in consultation with  ecumenical partners in Canada and our conversations with the work of  Theological Education in the Anglican Communion (TEAC).</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(General Synod Act 77) General Synod  also directed FWM and the Financial Management and Development Committee to  find ways to encourage the development of national funding sources for  theological education at both the basic and graduate studies level. The matter  is on the agenda for FMD, and a member of that committee will be present at  the national Heads of Anglican Colleges meeting in Saskatoon this June. Staff  worked with the leadership of Letting Down the Nets to develop a network of  College financial and development officers, and have begun to create a  portrait of the financial realities facing the Colleges, in cooperation with  the annual meeting of Heads of Anglican Colleges. </p>

    </ol>
      
    <li>(Act 59) <u>Renewal of Marriage Vows</u> General Synod 2004  authorized the existing service of Renewal of Marriage Vows found in <em>Occasional  Celebrations</em>, as requested by General  Synod 2001. </li>
    <li>(Act 80). <u>Blessing  and Celebration of a Civil Marriage</u>. General Synod 2004 authorized a new  liturgy for the Blessing and Celebration After a Civil Marriage. FWM ensured  its publication as a worship booklet and inclusion in <em>Anglican Liturgical  Licensing</em>.</li>
    <li>(Act 38) In response to the request for <u>study material on  marriage</u> the EI task group has -produced &ldquo;Marriage: An Exploration of  Marriage in Church &amp; Society&rdquo; which included material on: cohabitation  before marriage, divorce, civil vs. Christian marriage, same sex marriage, and  the blessing of a civil marriage.</li>
    <li>FWM assisted in the preparation of a second edition  publication by ABC of the <u>Marriage Canon</u> together with a theological  introduction and the Report of the Task Force on Marriage and Related Matters. </li>
    <li>(Act 64). <u>Dialogue with the United Church of Canada</u>.  This dialogue remains an important one for FWM to monitor. Reflection took place  on that Church&rsquo;s new creed. The dialogue has produced a study guide for  neighbouring congregations to use to explore our relationship. There was also an examination of  protocols that exist where there are joint Anglican-United Church clergy  appointments. Some of the work  initiated in this Dialogue is being taken up by a newly established Shared  Ministries Task Group which will monitor developments and recommend common  policies for Ecumenical Shared Ministries. The ELCIC and the Presbyterian Church in Canada have joined  the Anglican and the United Churches in this venture.</li>
    <li>(Act 38). <u>Blessing of Same Sex Unions-Resources for the  Church</u>. As many resources exist, FWM put together a comprehensive, though  not exhaustive resource list, and this is available to the Church on the Web  Site. An article was written for the Anglican Journal. FWM is committed to making these  resources available to the church, in as accessible a way as possible. It is  important to use formats and language translations which are both appropriate  and user &ndash;friendly. FWM remains concerned about the difficulty and the cost of  obtaining translations of its major documents and wants to keep before the  church the importance of doing so. An added complexity is the task of  providing written materials for cultures that are primarily oral. Serious  attention needs to be given in our church to cross cultural realities of  language, beyond that of translation. Part of the resources includes an  annotated bibliography, how to find resources, how to conduct conversations,  and a glossary of terms. This glossary has been translated into a variety of  languages. Discussions have been held with some First Nations people about how  to engage with these matters. We have kept in mind the need for resources both  on human sexuality (including same-sex blessings) and the changing nature of  marriage in our society.</li>
    <li>(Act 75). <u>Code of Ethics</u>. Through its EI task group,  &ldquo;We Will, with God&rsquo;s Help&rdquo;, a Guide to Codes of Ethics for those Authorized to  Practice Ministry in the Anglican Church of Canada has been produced. This document and will be coming to  the 2007 meeting of the General Synod for approval and commendation to  dioceses, encouraging each of them to develop a code of ethics for ministry.  See <strong><a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a221.htm">Resolution A221</a></strong> and <a href="/gs2007/rr/reports/report-10-b.htm">Appendix B</a>.</li>
    <li>(Act 84). <u>Roman Catholic Relations</u>: The Gift of  Authority. FWM has promoted the study of this document in the Anglican Church  of Canada. However, few responses have been received</li>
    <li>(Act 65) <u>Changes to Episcopal Services Language</u>.  Changes have been made in both printed and electronic forms of the Book of  Alternative Services to reflect gender inclusivity in the office of bishop in  all services. </li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>IV. MATTERS  REFERRED TO FWM BY CoGS</strong></p>
  <p>1.<u>Sexuality,  Same Sex Blessings, The Anglican Church of Canada and the Anglican Communion</u></p>
  <p>As noted above,  this issue dominated much of FWM&rsquo;s work.</p>
  <p>During the course  of the Triennium, the Primate&rsquo;s Theological Commission produced the St.  Michael Report. FWM developed a guide to help the church study this document.  We were helped by members of the Clericus of the Diocese of Quebec who took  part in one of our sessions at our meeting in Quebec City. We were also  grateful that a member of FWM, Dr. Walter Deller was also a member of the  Primate&rsquo;s Theological Commission.</p>
  <p>FWM received  responses to the St. Michael Report and a summary is included in <a href="/gs2007/rr/reports/report-10-c.htm">Appendix C</a>.</p>
  <p>FWM was also asked  to give guidance to CoGS as to the disposition of the report at the 2007  General Synod</p>
  <p>Early in the  triennium, the Lambeth Commission on Communion, known as the Windsor Report  was issued. FWM Director, Canon Alyson Barnett-Cowan was a member of the  Lambeth Commission. The Primate requested a Windsor Report Response Group to  obtain response from the Church which would guide him at meetings of the Primates,  and to give guidance to the Anglican Church of Canada. Three members of FWM  served on this the Windsor Report Response Group, including its chair, Dr.  Patricia Bays. The AR task group worked on what an Anglican Communion Covenant  might look like.</p>
  <p>FWM engaged in a  reflection both theological and legal as to what is meant by &ldquo;reception&rdquo;, as  in what would it mean for a document such as the Windsor Report or the  Virginia Report to be &ldquo;received&rdquo; by a province of the Anglican Church. It was  noted, for instance, that though the Virginia Report was never received by  provinces, some of its recommendations, such as the instruments of unity, are  referred to as operative in the church. A suggestion about what reception  could mean in the Canadian Church was sent to CoGS for its consideration, and  clarification was sought from the Chancellor of General Synod.</p>
  <p>At its fifth  meeting, FWM made recommendations to CoGS as to how the Windsor Report, in  conjunction with the St. Michael report might be handled at General Synod. We  were grateful to the Prolocutor for his visit and advice on this matter. We  were also grateful to the Chancellor of the Diocese of Toronto, Canon Robert  Falby for his visit to our final meeting as we continued to wrestle with what  advice we should give to CoGS</p>
  <p>Mindful of its  mandate concerning doctrine, liturgy, authority and identity in our own church  as well as monitoring these matters in the Anglican Communion, FWM also made  recommendations regarding our church&rsquo;s presentation at the Anglican  Consultative Council, and our concern that our duly elected members were being  asked not to participate in that council&rsquo;s deliberations.</p>
  <p>Because of the  on-going and no doubt demanding time commitment the sexuality issue and its  impact on our church and the communion will take, FWM is recommending that a  special group be set up by General Synod to handle this matter, and the  Council of General Synod has agreed to establish an Anglican Communion Working  Group, made up, as the Windsor Report Response Group was, of members of FWM,  Partners-in-Mission, and the House of Bishops. The first task of this group will be to monitor diocesan  responses to the draft Covenant.</p>
  <p>FWM is bringing a  resolution commending the October 2006 Statement of the House of Bishops. <strong><a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a224.htm">See Resolution A224</a>.</strong></p>
  <p>2. <u>Open Meeting  Policy</u></p>
  <p>FWM basically  concurred with the policy as developed by CoGS, but requested that it be  amended to: a closed meeting may be held to discuss personnel issues, contract  proposals, litigation and/or at the request of a member of the committee  subject to section 3.3&rdquo;/ and that section 2.3 be amended by deleting the  existing sentence and replacing it by &ldquo;The Council of General Synod and the  Standing Committees of General Synod as outlined in Section 39 of the Constitution  of General Synod.</p>
  <p>3. <u>Anti-racism</u></p>
  <p>As noted, FWM  received training in Anti-racism which was highly valued by the members. It is  hoped that General Synod itself will be able to give attention to this issue.</p>
  <p><strong>V. MATTERS  REFERRED TO FWM FROM OTHER BODIES</strong></p>
  <p>1. <u>Liturgical  texts and electronic publishing, including copyright issues</u>.</p>
  <p>During the  triennium, FWM had several conversations concerning a proposal for Anglican  Church involvement in a project under development by the publishing arms of  the Church of England and the Episcopal Church (USA).  The project will enable electronic liturgical planning tools using our  authorized texts to be tested in parishes of the Anglican Church of Canada and  subsequently available to congregations. The proposal sparked secondary  conversations about complex issues of the copyright of liturgical texts, the  right of parishes and dioceses to duplicate the church&rsquo;s resources, the  rightness of charging royalties to congregations and other church based  organizations, and the impact of all of this on future liturgical reform and  the principles involved. A paper was produced on the topic, &ldquo;Principles to  guide the preparation of platforms for the liturgical planning using the  liturgical resources of the Anglican Church of Canada. This paper was shared  with the publisher of the Anglican Book Centre, the communications and  Information Resources Committee, and the Financial Management and Development  Committee. A resolution was sent to CoGS with advice on the matter, and FWM  gave its approval to proceed with the project. In a related action, FWM, in  consultation with CIRC, brought a motion to COGS asking that copyright fees  not be charged to parishes, dioceses and other bodies of the Anglican Church  of Canada for duplication of liturgical texts, but that the right to charge  fees be retained with respect to commercial enterprises. This motion passed as  a resolution of CoGS in May of 2006 and is included as <a href="/gs2007/rr/reports/report-10-d.htm">Appendix D</a>.</p>
  <p>2. <u>Ecumenical  Participation in Ordinations</u></p>
  <p>FWM studied the  document, &ldquo;Guidelines for Ecumenical Participation in Ordinations&rdquo; formulated  by the Inter-Anglican Standing Commission on Ecumenical Relations which has  been proposed for all churches of the Anglican Communion as the standard to be  followed by the Church in all situations in which Anglican bishops and priests  are invited to participate in ordinations outside the Anglican Communion, or  in which clergy of other churches are invited to participate in Anglican  ordinations. FWM approves these guidelines and sends them to the General Synod  for adoption. See <strong><a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a222.htm">Resolution A222</a></strong> and  <a href="/gs2007/rr/reports/report-10-e.htm">Appendix E</a>.</p>
  <p>3. <u>French  translations of liturgical texts</u></p>
  <p>FWM gratefully  receives translations of our liturgical texts from Le Comit&eacute; Liturgique  Episcopale francophone (CLEF). It asked CoGS to approve for trial use and  evaluation texts for Night Prayers, Services of the Word, and the Ordination  of Bishops, Priests and Deacons and is bringing these texts to this General  Synod for authorization where permitted by the Ordinary. CLEF looks to further  guidance to shape its continued mandate. <strong>See <a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a223.htm">Resolution A223</a></strong> and <a href="/gs2007/rr/reports/report-10-f.pdf">Appendix F</a>.</p>
  <p>4. <u>Theological  Education for the Anglican Communion (TEAC)</u></p>
  <p>FWM received a  visit from Bishop Ann Tottenham who represents the Canadian Church on TEAC. We  have been given copies of the training grids and expectations for those who  serve in holy orders as well as the laity. The TEAC material will be valuable  as it continues to inform the discussion on our own theological education  issues. The grids have been shared with all bishops and theological colleges  and constructive critical appraisals and adaptations to our Canadian context  have been sought.</p>
  <p>5. <u>Youth  Initiatives</u></p>
  <p>The FWM Department  has been the Church House home for Judy Steers who is the part time youth  consultant at the national level as well as being the Director of the highly  effective Ask and Imagine programme. Judy&rsquo;s primary work for General Synod was the  establishment of the website &lsquo;Generation&rsquo; (<a href="http://www.generation.anglican.ca/">www.generation.anglican.ca</a>). While not having oversight of Judy&rsquo;s  work, the FWM Committee has served as a support group. We are continually impressed by the  quality of that programme and hope that it receives wide support from the  church. Youth Initiatives need to find a proper home in General Synod and be  supported by budget if they are to continue at the national level.</p>
  <p><strong>VI. ON-GOING  WORK OF FAITH WORSHIP AND MINISTRY</strong></p>
  <p>Much of the work of  FWM derives from its mandate as well as applying the mandate to The Framework.  I highlight as much of this as I can, though no doubt there will be omissions.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Through AR, and mindful of the need in the Framework to  strengthen Anglican identity, FWM has developed a &ldquo;<u>Travel Kit</u>&rdquo; for  pilgrims, which is a list of basic resources. As part of this kit, The Rev&rsquo;d  Canon Dr. Kim Murray has been commissioned to write an introduction to  Anglican Foundational documents.  ABC hopes to have this published in time for General Synod.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    
    <li>A related project is a resource list compiled by MWTh on  various programmes in the church that <u>nurture baptismal ministry</u>. This  is an ongoing, web-based project of interactive resource sharing. See  <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/faith/education/fsu.htm">http://www.anglican.ca/faith/education/fsu.htm</a><br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li>I have already noted the need for <u>translation not just of  liturgical texts into French and First Nation languages, but other important  documents</u> (such as the St. Michael Report) and the difficulty of obtaining  these. FWM is also aware that in  the more multi-cultural centres of the country, translations, especially of  liturgical texts into languages such as Cantonese, Mandarin, Spanish,  Japanese, Tamil, Sudanese and other would be valuable. FWM continues to  monitor this need and the development of local initiatives in translation  work.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Full Communion Partnership with the ELCIC</u>. FWM  resources this partnership in a variety of ways, such as taking part in a  study of the diaconate, co-sponsoring and providing leadership at a national  Liturgy Conference every two years and reciprocating membership on various  committees. It also monitors progress of the Anglican-Lutheran Joint  Commission, and it is hoped that the membership might be expanded,  particularly to include persons in the order of deacon.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Ecumenical Dialogue</u>. Many different dialogues are  monitored and membership is provided. Some of these are of higher priority  than others. Of note are: the Roman Catholic-Anglican dialogues which operate  at different levels in the communion.  The ARCIC documents The Gift of Authority, and, Mary-Grace and Hope in  Christ (the most recent document, which we commend to parishes for study). FWM  was visited by the Rev&rsquo;d Canon Dr. John Gibaut who serves internationally on  the Anglican- Orthodox Theological Dialogue. FWM will be asking General Synod  to welcome the publication of the work of the International Commission titled,  &ldquo;The Cyprus Statement: The Church of the Triune God, and commend it for study  in the church. <strong><a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a220.htm">See Resolution  A220</a></strong>. The Anglican-United Church dialogue  also receives attention as does the Oriental Orthodox and Moravian dialogues.  In addition, FWM nominates persons to serve on the Canadian Council of  Churches (Archdeacon Pierre Voyer, a FWM members is a Vice President) the  Canadian Council of Churches Faith and Witness Commission, the Church&rsquo;s  Council on Theological Education, The World Council of Churches Assembly, The  World Council of Churches Faith and Order Commission, the Anglican Roman  Catholic Dialogue and the board of the Canadian Centre for Ecumenism  (Montreal). <br />
      <br />
    We had hoped to  have a conference of Diocesan Ecumenical Officers, but that had to be  postponed due to budget restrictions.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Inter-faith Dialogue </u>Four conversations are monitored  and support provided: i) the Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation (Anglican  Members: Kevin Flynn and Linda  Nicholls; ii) the National Muslim Christian Liaison Committee of Canada  (Anglican members, Michael Bedford-Jones and Linda Nicholls serve here); iii)  The World Conference on Religion and Peace; and, iv) The Canadian Council of  Churches Interfaith Relations Committee (Anglican Member: Linda Nicholls).<br />
      <br />
    Inter-faith work  has become increasingly important because of situations both at home in Canada  and in the world at large. Staff maintain contact with the Interfaith Officers  appointed in each diocese. I  suspect this area will loom larger in the next few years. FWM is bringing a  motion to General Synod 2007 to encourage the Anglican Church of Canada to  engage in inter-faith education and dialogue at the local level, ecumenically  wherever possible, and to direct FWM to advise the church on available  resources. <strong><a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a225.htm">See Resolution  A225</a>.<br />
    <br />
    </strong></li>
    <li><u>Human Life Task Force </u>In fulfillment of a mandate from  General Synod 2001 the Human Life Task Force was formed. In the light of emerging medical  technologies, biotechnology, beginning and end of life and genetic engineering  issues, the Task Force will provide ethical and theological reflection.  Initial work has centered around the potential pandemic (ethical issues,  responsibilities for care; and theological reflection) and monitoring stem  cell research concerns. This work  is in its early stages. <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Congregational Development</u> Congregational Development  was referred to FWM as a response to the call in the Framework to strengthen  local congregations and dioceses. With a small national planning team Linda  Nicholls proposed, a national symposium  &lsquo;Nurturing Healthy Parishes&rsquo; which was held in March 2007 with 58  participants from across Canada As well, material has been added to the  national web site under &lsquo;Healthy Parishes&rsquo;. Further networking and support is envisioned.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Diaconal Formation</u> Through its MWTh task group, and in  consultation with the Association of Anglican Deacons in Canada, FWM continues  to monitor developments in  diocesan initiatives relating to the discernment, formation, education and deployment  of deacons. <br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>The National Aboriginal  Bishop</u> FWM listened intently to its ACIP partner, Maria Highway, and sent  its support for the National Aboriginal Bishop to CoGS.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>The Reserved Sacrament</u> FWM conducted a survey of Dioceses across the Church with regard to the use of  the Reserved Sacrament by Deacons and Lay People. A guiding principles  document published in 1988 was also reviewed. The results of this survey were  forwarded to the House of Bishops.<br />
      <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Communications</u> The FWM  staff is to be highly commended for their work on the Committee&rsquo;s section of  the National Church Website. A considerable amount of material for the benefit  of the church is located there.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Other ministry matters</u> Under Eileen Scully&rsquo;s direction, a survey is being conducted of the worship  lives of the theological colleges. Through the website, we have asked for  critical, constructive assessments of the TEAC grids as tools for theological  education. <br />
      <br />
    There is  continued work with the ACPO national bishop and Provincial ACPO secretaries  dealing with privacy legislation, records retention, discernment and training  of ACPO assessors, the role of spousal programs where available, and the  relationships between diocesan, ACPO and College processes within the wider  discernment process for the priesthood. <br />
    <br />
    FWM participates  in the Program Committee for Leadership for Ministry of the ELCIC. Eileen  Scully and Alyson Barnett Cowan have participated in a conversation with the  Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, the Anglican Church of Canada, The  Episcopal Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. This deals  with parallel articulated expectations for ministerial formation and  education. <br />
    <br />
    Staff monitors  parallel work, such as reassessment and developments of formation and training  for ministry standards, as well as mutual ministry formation in some other  provinces of the communion.<br />
    <br />
    During the  meeting at Sorrento, FWM met with representatives of the Anglican Parishes of  the Central Interior (APCI) and the Diocese of Kootenay to hear how those  parts of our church are dealing with ministry formation, including practices  where people are both locally raised and trained.<br />
    <br />
    Canon John Hill  and the Rev. David Montgomery of the Diocese of Toronto visited MWTh to update  it on work being done in Catechumenate processes, including the development of  catechumenal rites which have been forwarded to the next FWM for their  consideration. <br />
    <br />
    </li>
    <li><u>Liturgy and Worship</u> Liturgy and Worship matters are central to the work of FWM and are part of its  mandate.<br />
    <br />
      Reference has  already been made to the issues of copyright and electronic publishing and  duplication of texts.<br />
      <br />
    FWM sponsored The  Rev&rsquo;d Dr. Paula Sampson to attend the International Anglican Liturgical  Consultation in Prague in 2005, the topic of which was &ldquo;Anglican Identity and  Worship&rdquo;, and will sponsor Captain, The Rev&rsquo;d Michelle Staples to attend the  Consultation in Palermo in 2007, the topic of which will be funeral rites. We  note the leadership of FWM member, The Rev&rsquo;d Dr. Richard Leggett, and staff,  Dr. Eileen Scully in these consultations. See <a href="http://www.aco.org/liturgy/docs/ialc2005statement.htm">www.aco.org/liturgy/docs/ialc2005statement.htm<br />
    <br />
    </a>FWM appoints the  Anglican Co-chair to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada/Anglican Church  of Canada biannual Worship Conferences, and plays a key role in developing the  themes and planning the conferences. The Rev&rsquo;d Cheryl Toth served as Anglican  co-Chair for the 2006 Worship Conference in Regina, with the Rev&rsquo;d Dr. Richard  Leggett and the Rev&rsquo;d John Bell as keynote speakers. The Rev&rsquo;d Bruce Meyer is  serving as co-chair for the 2008 Conference, to take place in Montreal with  liturgical theologians Gordon Lathrup and Karen Ward as speakers.<br />
    <br />
    FWM appoints  representatives to the ELCIC Programme Committee for Worship (PCW). Ms. Mary  Dove and Eileen Scully served as FWM&rsquo;s liaison to the PCW for this triennium.<br />
    <br />
    FWM continues to  monitor revision of the Revised Common Lectionary Propers prayers, work on  which has been ongoing by a team of writers from across the country for several  years now.<br />
    <br />
    The MWTh task  group spent considerable time reflecting on the future of Liturgical Revision  in the Anglican Church of Canada, as did the whole FWM committee. Informal  discussions were held with some members of the House of Bishops on the matter.  There is a motion being brought to General Synod, &ldquo;that this General Synod  directs the Faith Worship and Ministry Committee to prepare principles and an  agenda for common worship texts revision.&rdquo;<strong> <a href="/gs2007/rr/resolutions/a226.htm">See Resolution A226</a>.<br />
    <br />
    </strong></li>
    <li><u>Visits</u> Note has  already been made of some of those who were kind enough to meet with FWM to  assist it with its work. In addition to those already mentioned, the Committee  also met with representatives of Essentials, Canon Charles Masters and Mr.  Garth Hunt, as well as Mr. Robert Maclennan of the Anglican Book Centre and  Ms. Judy Steers, Director of Ask and Imagine and youth consultant for the  church.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>VII. FUTURE WORK</strong></p>
  <p>At its final  meeting, FWM worked on suggested priorities for the next triennium as well as  messages for the next FWM Committee. These of course are only a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; at  this time. We share these with you.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Theological  Education: national standards and resources for theological education and  formation for laity lay ministries, deacons, priests and bishops.</li>
    <li>Theological  reflection on ecclesiology</li>
    <li>Principles  and agenda for revision of common worship texts (if passed by General Synod)  (and ongoing liturgical work if it doesn&rsquo;t pass)</li>
    <li>Responding  and engaging with emerging issues in the Anglican Communion</li>
    <li>Environmental  ethics &ndash; encouraging of Greening of Parishes and other local environmental  initiatives </li>
    <li>Tending to external networks  working on worship projects: ELCIC-ACC Worship conference, translations and  other liturgical projects</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The  results for priorities for working group projects were:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Doctrine  sub-group that can take the lead in monitoring ecclesiological, doctrinal and  ecumenical issues for the church</li>
    <li>Tending  to external networks working on worship projects: ELCIC-ACC Worship  conference, translations and other liturgical projects</li>
    <li>Follow-up  on Codes of Ethics &ndash; mid-triennium &ndash; check with dioceses re: progress in  establishing codes of ethics for practice of ministry, with attention to  sexual misconduct policies.</li>
    <li>Theological  education funding issues</li>
    <li>Military  Personnel &ndash; receiving back soldiers &ndash; considering a pastoral response to needs  of personnel, parishes and communities &ndash; <em>not</em> discussion of &lsquo;just war&rsquo; theories but a pastoral response.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>At  the request of the Prioritized Operational Plan Working Group we also reviewed  our meeting times and processes as well as membership to see if further  reductions could be made. However the current membership of seventeen plus  staff has replaced three former committees with fifty-four members. To reduce  further would require a major adjustment to the mandate of the committee and  recognition that the committee could not fulfill the work referred to it by  General Synod, CoGS and other bodies of the Church. Some of the task group  work can be done by conference call. However our experience is that it is  critical for the committee to meet face-to-face, since so much of our work is  not only done together, but the sense of community in producing that work is  necessary. The addition of congregational development and youth work to our  mandate will also require time and resources.</p>
  <p>In  reviewing the priorities for the next committee, we will need to have members  who are interested in or have expertise in ecclesiology, the nature of  ministry, liturgy, theological education (including First Nations), Anglican  Communion issues, ecumenical and inter-faith interest and the doctrinal  matters that arise from them. We would also recommend that someone in deacon&rsquo;s  orders be part of the committee.</p>
  <p>During  the past triennium, FWM has endeavored to make sure that its work was  consistent with the Framework. As such, the New Agape, our full communion  ELCIC partners, networking and anti-racism shaped our present work and will in  the future.</p>
  <p>At the outset of  the triennium, I, as Chairperson, was alarmed at both the enormity of the  mandate and of the sheer amount of work that needed to be accomplished. That  FWM was able to meet so many of its priorities is a tribute to the skills and  dedication of its members. But without the consistently high level of  commitment and work done by the FWM staff, this would not have happened.  Certainly my responsibilities as chairperson were made entirely possible by  the staff. We are indeed blessed  to have each and every one of them.</p>
  <p>Respectfully  submitted,</p>
  <p>The Right Reverend  Michael H.H. Bedford-Jones<br />
    Chairperson, Faith,  Worship and Ministry Committee</p>
