      <p>It is in the church&rsquo;s best interest to become more proactive in seeking planned and major gifts in support of its ministry and mission. Gift planning vehicles enable Anglicans to experience the joy of making substantial gifts to their church. Cash or deferred gifts can actually increase personal income levels. Anglicans can leave substantial amounts to their family, to charities and the church on their death. This can be done painlessly, without jeopardizing present security.</p>
      <p>In recent years, partnership agreements between General Synod and some dioceses have enabled General Synod to fund and support planned giving consultants who have achieved outstanding results.</p>
      <p>We want to increase planned giving activity across the country and to cultivate major supporters and potential givers. Based on current national experience at least&nbsp; $25 million could be raised in the next four years this way. Some of this money would support endowments to generate interest income in years ahead.</p>
      <p>The planned giving consultants program should be expanded so that all dioceses can benefit from the services they provide. We will provide optional cost-sharing agreements with dioceses that will provide full funding for a consultant in the first year and decreasing funding in subsequent years. The plan will also pay for training and support in the implementation of a planned or major gift program.</p>
      <p>This initiative will cost $1.8 million over four years, including the salary of a proposed National Manager of Financial Development as well as additional regional and diocesan consultants. By the end of the four years every diocese should have access to a planned giving consultant.</p>
