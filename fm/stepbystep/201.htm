      <p class="firsttext"><span class="firsttextcaps">You can call</span> the Primate many things. You can say he&rsquo;s the President
        of General Synod, or the Chair of the House of Bishops, or the Chief
        Executive Officer of General Synod staff. You can describe him as archbishop,
        leader, director, chief. Or you can just call him Andrew.</p>
      <p class="text">In his first full year in office, Archbishop Andrew
          Hutchison, already thought of by many as the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s primate,&rdquo; made
        a point of being accessible to church members from coast to coast. By
        the end of 2005, he had visited all but five dioceses. Away from home
        about 50 to 60 per cent of the time, he participates in parish celebrations,
        clergy gatherings, young people&rsquo;s events and synods. </p>
      <p class="text">His regular webcasts &mdash; <em>+Andrew: Conversations
          with the Primate</em> &mdash;&nbsp; continued
        throughout 2005 and touched on such topics as the tsunami in south Asia,
        the meeting of the primates of the Anglican Communion in Ireland, a historic
        partnership between Canadian and Cuban churches, residential schools,
        and the church in China.</p>
      <p class="text">Traveling and the webcasts are part of Andrew&rsquo;s
          determination to close gaps in communication among church members as
          well as between church and the media, church and politics. He says
          he wants all voices to be heard, especially in times of contentious
          and difficult issues such as same-sex blessings. He assumed the primacy
          with a promise that he would draw people into the conversation and
        he is working hard to keep that pledge.</p>
      <p class="text">Acutely aware of his financial responsibility to the whole church, the
        Primate has offered to raise part of the budget for his own office from
        outside sources. Last year, a special dinner was held at which friends
        and supporters of the church contributed enough money to make that offer
        real.</p>
      <p class="storytext">This year the Primate will attend the World
          Council of Churches&rsquo; gathering
      in Brazil. </p>
      <p class="storytext">Last year he went to China as part of an ecumenical
          group (Presbyterian, United Church and Anglican). He also visited churches
          in Cuba, attended the Primates&rsquo; Meeting in Northern Ireland, and met with the Archbishop
        of Canterbury. In one of his webcasts, he said his own ideas about China,
        before traveling there, were &ldquo;about 20 years out of date.&rdquo; He
        explained there are more than 17 million Chinese Protestants and the
        number is growing rapidly. To see or download the webcasts, go to <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/conversations">www.anglican.ca/conversations</a></p>
