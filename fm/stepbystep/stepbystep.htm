          Anglicans remember where their hearts are. In every congregation across
          the land, they give what they can. But societal circumstances reflect
          on these givings, and in 2005, diocesan contributions slipped. It was
          a marginal decline and the financial departments of General Synod anticipated
          it. But it was indicative of a changing era &mdash;&nbsp; and perhaps
      some challenges ahead.</p><table width="300" border="0" align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="moneytable">

        one knows for sure how things will go in 2006. Some dioceses have expressed
        their intent to increase givings by 6 per cent. Others will not be able
        to keep up to their traditional contributions. </p>
      <p align="left" class="text">Congregational
        development programs may help bring new families to church or to bring
        the baby boomers back. In 2006 a pilot project for financial stewardship
        and congregational development will be introduced to five dioceses, and
        this may start a new momentum of giving. This project, called <em>Letting Down the Nets, </em>aims,
        among other things, at encouraging dioceses to contribute 26 per cent
        of revenues to the work of General Synod.</p>
      <p class="storytextfirst">Parishioners have struggled with
          many financial issues in their communities, their families, and their
          church. One heavy responsibility is&nbsp; the
        Residential Schools Settlement Fund, which requires contributions beyond
        parishioners&rsquo; usual offerings. They responded to that fund with
        determination, and it understandably took its toll in the offering plates. </p>
      <p class="storytext">However, the financial end of Anglicans&rsquo; commitment&nbsp; is
          within sight. There is hope that the size of our financial commitment
          may be reduced and that the church can move away from an emphasis on
          raising money to doing what it does best: providing programs to assist
      in healing and reconciliation.</p>      </td>
