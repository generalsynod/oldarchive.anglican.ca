      <p class="firsttext"><span class="firsttextcaps">No one can</span> predict the future with certainty. But we can look at the
        past and that helps. We can study performance. We can anticipate based
        on experience. And from that we can get a pretty good idea of what tomorrow
        might look like.</p>
      <p class="text">Our
        Anglican Church of Canada is on that <em>tomorrow</em> road. It is not
        always smooth. There are potholes and bumps and bad weather. We face
        a long journey. </p>
      <p class="text">This
        Narrative Budget for 2006 attempts to explain to you whose church this
        is and whose servant General Synod is, where we have been, how we have
        traveled, and where we hope to go. </p>
      <p class="text">It
        isn&rsquo;t all good news. But it is not all desperately bad, either.
        This document is a hard &ndash; and essential &ndash; look at what we
        might expect in a volatile, ever-changing world.</p>
      <p class="text">We
        know our strengths. They lie within all of us: within congregations and
        parishes, dioceses and individuals. They lie within renewed leadership
        at the national level and right across the country. They lie with your
        increasing support of the Anglican Appeal, the <em>Anglican Journal</em>,
        The Anglican Foundation and the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development
        Fund. They lie with the imagination and enthusiasm we have all shown
        in raising 65 per cent of the money needed to meet our $25 million commitment
        to the Residential Schools Settlement Fund.</p>
      <p class="text">We
        know our weaknesses, too. Our congregations are aging and shrinking.&nbsp; Controversial
        topics such as same-sex unions threaten to divide us, to compromise our
        solidarity and curtail our ongoing financial commitment. </p>
      <p class="text">The
        road has been rough. We have been bruised. We have been hurt. </p>
      <p class="text">But
        one thing is sure: we share a love of this church and a determination
        to march forward along a rocky, challenging and often-painful path.</p>
      <h3>Where we are</h3>
      <p class="firsttext">We are, for the most part, an aging population. Many of
        us are part of the &ldquo;baby-boom&rdquo; generation. We grew up in
        a relatively privileged world. We married, worked, had children. We built
        up some wealth. Now we are retiring. We have resources to give. Our church
        buildings are aging; our congregations are dwindling; and the task of
        maintaining our church is more challenging for us than it was for our
      grandparents.</p>
      <p class="text">Because
        of our age and experience, we know how to ride through difficult times.
        We know, in fact, that difficult times often spark creative and innovative
        solutions. We know that in adversity, genius lurks.</p>
      <p class="text">Members
        of the Council of the North, for example, are working hard towards self-sufficiency.
        General Synod committees are finding significant ways to reduce expenses.
        Sometimes, for instance, they use modern communication to meet by teleconference,
        which takes a good chunk out of travel costs. </p>
      <p class="text">We
        are sharing more than ever before. Dioceses are taking on joint projects.
        Some of these include strategic planning, support services and theological
        resources. We are talking about using technology to our best advantage.
        This could involve a centralized system that would share statistical
        and financial information. It could mean bulk purchasing of equipment
        and software. </p>
      <p class="text"><em>Letting
          Down the Nets</em>, an imaginative and innovative program for stewardship
          and stewardship education reaches across the country and is also a
          self-sufficient initiative. General Synod sees it as one of its great
          opportunities and hopes. Ultimately, the program is designed to put
          the church back on strong financial ground.</p>
      <p class="text">We&rsquo;re
        on our way, one step at a time: one step from each of us. </p>
      <h3>Some of our Challenges</h3>
      <p class="firsttext">Anglicans right across the country responded from the heart to the creation
        of the Residential Schools Settlement Fund. They raised money; they dug
        into their own resources; they involved their congregations and parishes. </p>
      <p class="text">So
        far, their dedicated efforts have provided 65 per cent of the total amount.
        It is a massive and commendable undertaking.</p>
      <p class="text">But
        they are understandably tired. And there are so many competing causes.
        The fund still requires $8,900,000 for us to meet our $25 million commitment.
        It is often said that the last steps are the hardest. Final offerings
        to the Settlement Fund will be increasingly difficult.</p>
      <p class="text">Some
        dioceses may have to use a portion of their proportional giving funds
        (money that normally helps support the work of the church as a whole)
        to meet the rest of their Settlement Fund obligations. Adding to this,
        of course, are their own economic realities. Some of these are undeniably
        harsh.</p>
      <p class="text">Much
        remains unknown; late last year, the federal government announced a new
        agreement with Roman Catholic church entities that allows us to renegotiate
        some of the terms of our own agreement. These talks have begun and it
        is possible that they may ultimately result in a reduction of our financial
        commitment. Until those negotiations are done, however, the terms of
        the original agreement remain in force. </p>
      <p class="text">In
        the midst of all this, the church faces difficult societal matters. Same-sex
        unions and issues relating to the Anglican Church of Canada&rsquo;s place
        in the Anglican Communion could have a profound effect on the church&rsquo;s
        financial situation.</p>
      <h3>Where we are</h3>
      <p class="firsttext">When the budget for 2005 was approved, it balanced revenues and expenses
        for the year. It included the funds needed for the Residential Schools
        Settlement Fund.</p>
      <p class="text">But
        this &ldquo;break-even&rdquo; budget, created in the fall of 2004, came
        with certain assumptions. Many of these turned out to be inaccurate.
        In the winter, the General Synod Management Team came up with a revised
        budget to reflect correct assumptions.</p>
      <p class="text">The
        new budget reduced both revenue and expenses by $415,000.</p>
      <p class="text">One
        of the incorrect assumptions was that the Anglican Book Centre would
        produce a net profit of $200,000 in 2005. This was unrealistic, especially
        in light of large losses in previous years.</p>
      <p class="text">Another
        assumption was that the Anglican Appeal would increase its net results
        by 33 per cent year-over-year. This, too, proved impossible.</p>
      <p class="text">By
        this past fall, the revised budget proved to be a success. Even though
        revenue was $390,000 or 6 per cent below budget, expenses remained reasonable
        and constrained. At the end of the third quarter of 2005, General Synod
        had broken even.</p>
      <h3>Where we go from here</h3>
      <p class="firsttext">Although the proposed budget for 2006 is balanced, it will be a difficult
        year. There will be sacrifices and unforeseen obstacles. Departments
        of General Synod will all feel the pinch of reduced funding. There are
        increases in expenses that could not be predicted this time last year.</p>
      <p class="text">General
        Synod revenue for 2006 will be approximately 3 per cent less than the
        revised budget of 2005. The changes are broken down this way:</p>
      <ul class="text">
        <li class="text">Proportional giving is expected to be reduced by 3 per cent.</li>
        <li class="text">Investment income will be reduced by 11 per cent.</li>
        <li class="text">Planned giving revenue will be down by 10 per cent.
           <br />
           <br />
          (The amount of reduced proportional giving was not cut in stone when
        the budget was written. It was based on diocesan budgets, which were
      not all yet approved.) </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="firsttext"> We
        have budgeted for the Anglican Book Centre (ABC Merchandising and Retail)
        to increase its net profit from zero to $28,900. This is because of reduced
        staff, deferred publishing schedules, shortened store hours, and no more
        Saturday shopping. Naturally, it has been difficult. But ABC is ready
        to move forward with a lean staff and much-reduced resources. It has
        also launched a commercial web site which appears to be a success.</p>
      <p class="text">In
        order to work with these revenue decreases, overall General Synod expenses
        will have to be cut by approximately $515,000. Each department of General
        Synod is affected by these cuts, in magnitudes that range from 2 per
        cent to 21 per cent.</p>
      <p class="text">While
        expenses were reduced, we are also affected by cost increases. The General
        Secretary&rsquo;s office, for example, needs 6 per cent more to reinstate
        the full-time position of General Secretary. There are increases in costs
        over which we have no control. The cost of travel is going up.
        The <em>Anglican Journal</em>, hit with a reduction in the vital subsidies
        it receives from Heritage Canada and a substantial increase in postage
        costs, needs 6 per cent more. One <em>Anglican Journal</em> part-time
        position was eliminated to help compensate for this.</p>
      <h3>How we will survive</h3>
      <p class="firsttext">The Anglican Church has been around longer than any of us can remember.
        It has been part of the lives of many Canadians since they were born.</p>
      <p class="text">Like
        any institution that has existed this long, it has made mistakes. It
        has caused pain. </p>
      <p class="text">It
        has also lived in the world. It has been part of countless social transitions.
        It has witnessed profound changes within its own ranks. It faces more
        challenges as society continues to develop in different ways.</p>
      <p class="text">The
        Anglican Church has suffered in recent years, and so have its members.
        We are a family that knows its share of dysfunction, calamity, stress,
        and challenge. But we are a family nevertheless, and we will greet the
        next years in that spirit.</p>
      <p class="text">It
        has been extremely difficult to present this balanced budget for 2006.
        All of us, from General Synod staff to the Council of the North, dioceses
        and parishes, have been affected by downsizing and new priorities. Resources
        are stretched to the breaking point.</p>
      <p class="text">The
        next year will be one of continuing change. In order to progress, we
        will have to honor the principles of accountability, transparency, clarity
        and communication. Workloads may still need to change. Expenses may still
        have to be cut.</p>
      <p class="text">This
        is a balanced budget. But there is no room for contingency. It will require
        experienced and prudent oversight.</p>
      <p class="text">With
        your patience, gifts, and prayers, step by step, we know we will get
        there.</p>
