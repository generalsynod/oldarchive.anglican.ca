      <p class="firsttext"><span class="firsttextcaps">It&rsquo;s a wonderfully</span> active place, this Canadian church of ours.
        All across the country, from hamlet to metropolis, are everyday stories
        of life and death, joy and sorrow, renewal and destruction, vision and
        despair.</p>
      <p class="text">Our stories live within national church committees and they live in
        the dioceses. They happen in department decisions and in remote country
        churches. They span ages, occupations, and traditions.</p>
      <p class="text">Without someone to tell these stories, we would never
          know what people from one end of the church to the other are doing &ndash; what they&rsquo;re
        thinking, how they&rsquo;re feeling, what they endure, how they triumph.</p>
      <p class="text">It is the job of Communications and Information Resources to get these
        stories to us.</p>
      <p class="text">A major part of this department is the <em>Anglican Journal</em>,
          the church&rsquo;s national, editorially independent newspaper. The
          paper tells our stories every month from a national perspective. It
          comes to you with diocesan newspapers which are published in partnership
          with the national newspaper and which give localized accounts of the
        church and its people.</p>
      <p class="text">Another large element of Communications and Information Resources is
        ABC Publishing. It produces prayer books, hymn books, resources for parish
        programs, and books for church leaders. It is also the home of Path Books,
        which offers practical spirituality for everyday living. </p>
      <p class="text">The department publishes <em>Ministry</em>Matters, a magazine for clergy
        from coast to coast. It is the centre for media relations, the Web, the
        library, Anglican Video, graphic design and Anglican Journal circulation.</p>
      <p class="text">Communications and Information Resources has absorbed
          one of the largest reductions to the General Synod budget &ndash; about
        7 per cent of its funds.</p>
      <p class="text">To do this, it eliminated the job of a freelancer who laid out advertising
        copy for <em>The Journal</em>; reduced the ABC Publishing Manager&rsquo;s
        time to three-fifths; scaled down its publishing program for 2006; halved
        its resource production (brochures and booklets, for example); and dropped <em>Ministry</em>Matters
        for one edition. Committee expenses and administration costs were cut.
        Media Relations was cut back as well, although this service will need
        to be restored in 2007, a General Synod year. </p>
      <p class="storytext">When it comes right down to it, communication
          means sharing, plain and simple. As a church spanning so many thousands
          of miles and such a wide variety of people, sharing is a critical way
          of keeping us alive and connected. This is the job of Communications
          and Information Resources. From the Primate&rsquo;s webcast to stories originating across the nation,
        it is a lifeline. However, it, along with so much of the church&rsquo;s
      work, is operating in reduced circumstances.</p>
