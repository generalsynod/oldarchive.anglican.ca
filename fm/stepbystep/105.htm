      <p class="firsttext"><span class="firsttextcaps">One thing&rsquo;s</span> for sure. When the going gets rough, staff at the
        Anglican Book Centre know what to do. They simply do the best they can
        with what they have. At the end of 2005, what they had were shorter hours
        and fewer colleagues. Of all the areas of General Synod, theirs took
        the biggest cuts. It was painful. It was disappointing. It was miserable.
        But it was necessary because the bookstore had been losing money for
        several years and a business plan had to be found that would allow this
        important part of our ministry to survive without having to be subsidized
        by other equally important pieces of work. ABC managers, in the end,
        came up with their own plan and the staff is now making it work.</p>
      <p class="text">It used to be that the Book Store was open each weekday from 9 to 6
        and all day Saturdays. Suddenly, the store could only open weekdays from
        11 to 5 and not at all on Saturdays. This allowed little time for customers
        who were normally at work during the times the store was open. </p>
      <p class="text">When people called to place orders, there were fewer people to answer
        the phone. It was not at all unusual for customers to have to be put
        on hold for five, six, seven minutes. Distribution to sister stores slowed
        down as well. </p>
      <p class="text">The place is busy. The phones never stop ringing. Staff are stretched.
        They feel as though they are not getting things done. Books are not being
        shelved. Ordinary tasks are frequently ignored.</p>
      <p class="text">There is a bit of light in the midst of all this gloom. Two new retail
        staffers will ease some of the burden in 2006. They will help facilitate
        re-opening the store on Saturdays, although for shorter hours than before. </p>
      <p class="text">And, although it is one more thing to manage, ABC now offers sales online
        through its website (<a href="https://www.anglicanbookcentre.com">www.anglicanbookcentre.com</a>). Customers can order
        almost everything in the store. The website is a lifeline to those people
        who find shopping at ABC difficult because of the reduced hours.</p>
      <p class="storytext">ABC management recognizes that customers are good for staff morale.</p>
      <p class="storytext">Customers are generous in spirit. They are patient. They know what ABC
        is going through, and they recognize the importance of the ministry.
        General Synod knows this as well and is solidly behind ABC and its staff
        as they struggle to continue a vital retail ministry in an ever changing
        retail environment. ABC exists to serve and intends to continue.</p>
