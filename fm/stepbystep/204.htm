      <p class="firsttext"><span class="firsttextcaps">Despite enormous</span>        budget cuts and important staff changes, and thanks to the donations
        of many Anglicans, Partnerships continues to reach out to Canadian communities
        and across the world. But the department works with a heavy heart, knowing
        it can&rsquo;t provide what it has in past
        years. Partnerships&rsquo; Emerging Priorities budget line, for example,
        was reduced by $40,000 in 2005. That meant it couldn&rsquo;t respond
        in a substantial way to requests from partners for assistance. And now,
        for 2006, Partnerships funding will suffer even more with a further reduction
        of $140,000. This translates as more cuts to the grants program and to
      a reduction in mission staff.</p>
      <p class="text">Along with funding cuts, Partnerships in 2005 had
          to adjust to the temporary loss of its director. Dr. Ellie Johnson
          moved to the General Secretary&rsquo;s
        office after the General Secretary, Archdeacon Jim Boyles, retired. Philip
        Wadham, mission coordinator for Latin America and the Caribbean, took
        over as acting Partnerships director. One of his biggest challenges has
        been to run the department in the face of financial obstacles. As 2006
        began, Ms. Johnson, in the aftermath of the hiring of a new General Secretary,
        prepared to return to the helm.</p>
      <p class="text">Volunteers in Mission, a group of selfless Canadians who spend two years
        of their lives to help overseas partner churches, continue their work
        in Central America, East Africa, New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Uganda.
        Two new volunteers, Rev. Carolyn Langford from Ottawa, and Shirley Newell
        from Montreal, begin this year in Uganda and Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p class="text">Through its EcoJustice division, Partnerships is planning a Justice
        Camp for young people in Ottawa in May. Last summer it organized a hugely
        successful Food Justice Camp in Winnipeg. The camp attracted 45 people
        from several denominations. </p>
      <p class="text">EcoJustice is working closely with <em>Ask
          and Imagine</em>,
          a 10-day youth experience of living and learning in community, to help
          strengthen youth commitment in the church&rsquo;s justice ministry.
          It is developing an ecojustice web page and continues to work ecumenically.
          It hopes to keep sending volunteers to national and international ecojustice
        events.</p>
      <p class="storytext">Rev. Tessie Meadows, a Volunteer in Mission,
          is a vocational deacon from the parish of St. John the Evangelist,
          North Vancouver, in the Diocese of New Westminster. Last year, Tess
          left Canada for a two-year placement at St. Joseph&rsquo;s Anglican
        Church in Punta Gorda Town in Belize, Central America.</p>
      <p class="storytext">Joanne Chaytor is the first Volunteer in Mission from Newfoundland.
        She left home in September to work with the Anglican Church of Tanzania. </p>
      <p class="storytext">These dedicated volunteers work with Partnerships in response to requests
        from partner churches, agencies, and institutions throughout the world.</p>
