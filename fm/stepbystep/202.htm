        year, you might notice that it&rsquo;s not the same one you saw in 2005.
        Jim Boyles retired as General Secretary in June after more than a decade
        in office. Until a new person could be hired, Dr. Ellie Johnson, who
        normally heads up Partnerships and who is General Synod&rsquo;s longest-serving
        manager, took his place on an interim basis. </p>
      <p class="text">When she became Acting General Secretary, Ms. Johnson, like Jim Boyles,
        became chief operating officer of Church House. Every day she worked
        with key management staff and directors of all departments. She was the
        staff representative on the Residential Schools team and worked in liaison
        with the government. She was the lead staff member for the Council of
        General Synod as well as the General Synod Planning Committee.</p>

      <p class="text">In February, Archdeacon Michael Pollesel from the Diocese of Ontario
        takes over as the new General Secretary.</p>
      <p class="text">There have been other staff changes in this critical
          Church House office. In June, the General Secretary&rsquo;s assistant
          left, and near the end of the year, the human resources coordinator
        resigned.</p>
      <p class="text">Tough economic times lead to changes in 2005. The
          Mission Coordination Group was disbanded. This group was made up of
          representatives of General Synod national committees (as well as the
          Primate&rsquo;s Fund). It acted
        as a kind of sounding board for these councils, boards and committees
        and brought motions to the Council of General Synod on their behalf.
        This work has now been taken up by the Council of General Synod.</p>
      <p class="storytext">The Office of the General Secretary, as &ldquo;hub&rdquo; of Church
        House, is always busy. This year, with changes and especially with a
        new incumbent, the staff will undoubtedly face many challenges, not the
        least of which is preparing for General Synod in Winnipeg in 2007.</p>
