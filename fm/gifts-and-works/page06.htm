      <p class="pfirst"> Books. Vestments. Gifts. Greeting cards. The Publishing and Merchandising arm of Anglican Book Centre is more than an integral part of the church&rsquo;s resources. It is also a service and offers a &ldquo;must-stop&rdquo; shopping spot for book-lovers and gift-buyers. </p>
      <p> Anglicans (and for that matter, people of all denominations) know they will find high-quality, fairly priced items covering many interests. </p>
      <p> It is part of ABC Publishing&rsquo;s mandate to bring before the public the best and brightest Anglican writers in the country. The Merchandising and Distribution part of the operation ensures that those books are sold and provides a key service to Anglicans from coast to coast through a mail-order operation that brings the store to those who cannot visit in person. </p>
      <p> The Book Store, the largest religious book store in the country, is frequently busy. It is also always attractive and comfortable. The whole operation uses the most up-to-date retailing, merchandising and publishing practices in order to ensure its continuing financial viability and to enhance its ministry within the church. </p></td>
