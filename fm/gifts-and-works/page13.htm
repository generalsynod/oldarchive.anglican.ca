      <p class="sidebar"><em> There is the Gladys Cook story, the life of a remarkable native elder and survivor of residential schools, told through an unforgettable video produced by Anglican Video; there are stories about and from parishes and people, stories of events and issues, told through publications such as the church&rsquo;s national newspaper, </em> Anglican Journal <em> and the magazine, </em> Ministry<em> Matters; there is a poster-story about the way the church is organized; there is a new series of webcasts that connect the church with the Primate in an informal exchange of thoughts and ideas. </em></p>
      <p class="sidebar"><em> And on it goes. This is the way we are informed, the way we are connected. </em></p>

      <p class="pfirst"> Stories are at the heart of all civilizations and so it is with the church as well. Stories bind us together; they give us our identity and preserve our past; they explain our works and our hopes. Stories are our legacy to future generations that will some day look at us and attempt to understand who we were and what shaped us. </p>
      <p> Stories are the links we have to each other and to the world. Stories are communication in print, video, graphic design and the world-wide web. They give life to our community. Communications and Information Resources is the department that tells the church&rsquo;s stories<em> . </em> It creates and produces resources; it brings us to the rest of the world through media relations and corporate communications. In moving with the times it maintains a comprehensive website (www.anglican.ca) for all the world to see and use. </p>
      <p> Communications is a two-way process and this department also actively engages in listening to Anglicans from across the country so that their needs and wishes can be met. Many Anglicans in search of information encounter the department through the General Synod Library and the services it provides, on the front line of the listening and responding process. </p>
      <p> The components of the department are Anglican Video, <em> Anglican Journal</em>, the Web, the library, corporate communications and media relations, graphic design, database management/ <em> Anglican Journal </em> circulation and central services, which provides support for the other components. </p></td>
