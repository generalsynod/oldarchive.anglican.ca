      <p class="sidebar"><em> Margaret Shawyer and Dianne Izzard, of the General Secretary&rsquo;s office, put a great deal of energy, skill and experience into organizing meetings of General Synod. The triennial gathering, held in a different part of the country each session, eventually involves, as the meeting time draws near, the co-ordination of most of the employees who work at Church House.</em></p></td>

      </em><em> $150,766 </em></h2>
      <p class="pfirst"> When more than 300 delegates from each of the church&rsquo;s 30 dioceses come together as General Synod every three years, the task of planning and organizing the event is monumental. No sooner, in fact, does one General Synod gathering conclude than planning begins for the next. </p>
      <p> Bishops, clergy and lay members from across the country must be housed, fed, and informed and each person requires specific travel arrangements. They must have resources, documents and technology in order to participate, make decisions, offer opinions and then later, take what they have learned back to their dioceses. </p>
      <p> Each year money is set aside in a fund called General Synod Provision for this important gathering. </p></td>
