The General Secretary also provides helpful interpretation at the local level.

      <p class="pfirst"> Every house needs a foundation. At Church House, the foundation in many ways is the General Secretary&rsquo;s Office. </p>
      <p> Here a human resources consultant orchestrates training for staff, helps with hiring people and works on policies on behalf of about 100 employees. </p>
      <p> The General Secretary, as <em> chief operating officer, </em> deals on a day-today basis with key management staff. Archdeacon Jim Boyles, enables the directors of all departments, along with the Primate, to plan their overall work. The office also supports the Mission Coordination Group, where representatives of General Synod national committees (as well as the Primate&rsquo;s Fund) look at possible overlaps or gaps in their programs. It staffs the Planning and Agenda Team that allocates time for work that must be done at General Synod and at the Council of General Synod. </p>
      <p> History also falls under the jurisdiction of the General Secretary&rsquo;s Office, in the guise of the General Synod Archives, a unique and priceless collection of historic documents, artifacts, photographs, church records and books.</p>
      <p>But the largest task of the General Secretary&rsquo;s office is to organize and plan meetings of General Synod and  the Council of General Synod. </p></td>
