Bishops and archbishops carry a huge weight of responsibility for the health of their dioceses and the national church.

      <p class="pfirst"> About 40 bishops and archbishops from across Canada work to keep each other informed. Twice a year they come together, usually in Mississauga, Ont., near Toronto, to consult on current issues before the church and to discuss spiritual, moral and leadership matters. </p>
      <p> Once a year, bishops from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada join the Anglicans for part of their meetings. Once every three years bishops&rsquo; spouses also attend a meeting. Once in a while meetings are held with bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States. </p>
      <p> The gatherings, which generally last about four days, are an important time of fellowship, education and decision-making; they are an essential element in the bishops&rsquo; ever-deepening understanding of the church&rsquo;s interests, circumstances and needs. </p></td>
