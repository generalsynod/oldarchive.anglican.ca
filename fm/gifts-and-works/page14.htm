The document is entitled </em> Letting Down the Nets <em> and is part of the Framework for work and mission of the church approved by General Synod last summer. </em> Letting Down the Nets <em> is a down-to-earth description of the church&rsquo;s present situation as well as a plan for the future. It shows that there are donors and financial resources available to ensure the church&rsquo;s future &ndash; that enough resources can be found at all levels of the church. </em></p>

      <p class="pfirst"> The office of Financial Development creates and maintains a national Gift Planning program and oversees Anglican Appeal. It also consults with dioceses to support them in their own financial development. It shares resources and ideas throughout the country and publicizes training events for diocesan staff and volunteers. </p>
      <p> The national church is everybody. It is not just a building or a group of people you don&rsquo;t know. It is a team, from parishes through to General Synod. It is you &ndash; the very reason the church exists at all.</p>
      <p>National church staff work to keep you informed about the money you give. They encourage you to continue making the work of the church a priority. Their mission is to keep the church alive for generations to come.</p></td>
