      <p class="pfirst"> Archbishop Andrew Hutchison, Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada, believes that the church must build relationships with the media, youth, government leaders and people from all walks of life around the country and the world. </p>
      <p> &ldquo;People want to be heard, understood, valued and, most importantly, involved,&rdquo; he says. </p>
      <p> As pastor to the whole church and chief executive officer of General Synod, the Primate presides over meetings of the House of Bishops, the Council of General Synod and General Synod. He is an ex-officio member of all committees, councils and boards. He is chair of the Metropolitan Council of the Episcopal Church of Cuba. He represents Canadian Anglicans in world forums (such as the Lambeth Conference, the Primates&rsquo; Meeting and the World Council of Churches). He also chairs Management Team &ndash; General Synod departmental directors &ndash; who meet once a month. </p>
      <p> You would think, with all these responsibilities, that he&rsquo;d have a huge staff, but in fact there are only two others in his office &ndash; a principal secretary and an executive assistant. Since the Primate spends a great deal of time &ldquo;on the road&rdquo;, these two staff members provide research, office support and travel arrangements and also help to respond to correspondence. </p></td>
