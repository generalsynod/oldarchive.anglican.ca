      <p class="sidebar"><em> In recognition of this, a recent General Synod initiative co-ordinates fundraising ventures by the Anglican Appeal, the Anglican Foundation, the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund, the Anglican Journal, the Healing Fund and Gift Planning. Fundraisers in each of these areas work with diocesan and parish leaders to clarify needs, to explain their goals, ministries and strategies to you and to avoid overlap. </em></p>

      <p class="pfirst"> &ldquo;Consider your possessions loaned to you by God,&rdquo; said St. Catherine of Siena in the 14th century. </p>
      <p> Anglicans frequently wish to return their gifts &ndash; to their families and to their church. They do this while they are alive; they also continue the generosity after they have died. In either case, they experience the joy of giving. </p>
      <p> Gift Planning helps streamline and channel such gifts through a variety of ways in which you, as the donor, and the church, as the recipient, both benefit. </p>
      <p> National Gift Planning consultant, Archdeacon John Robertson, guides parishioners to the best way of allocating funds to a parish or diocese, to the Anglican Foundation, to General Synod&rsquo;s ministries or programs or to the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund. He and 10 regional consultants, funded in part by General Synod, also work closely with parishes to help develop strategies to encourage these gifts. Donors seek and receive solid advice on how their wills can reflect their interests and priorities &ndash; &ldquo;to make a statement,&rdquo; says Archdeacon Robertson, &ldquo;about who they are.&rdquo; </p></td>
