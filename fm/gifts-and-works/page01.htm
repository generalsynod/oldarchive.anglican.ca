      <p class="pfirst">It's a busy church, this Anglican Church of Canada. Its impact is felt across the country and throughout the world. Its work begins with each of us, with every person, in every parish, in every part of this vast land. </p>
      <p> Its work begins in a place you know &ndash; the pew you occupy in your church on Sundays. </p>
      <p> From each offering placed in the collection plate by you and your fellow parishioners, the church reaches out to the poor, the lonely, the oppressed. From each and every pew, it touches people of all ages and many nationalities around the globe. From each cheque sent to the Anglican Appeal, the Anglican Church reaches out to make life better for someone. </p>
      <p> Your donations are not just numbers to be totaled up. They are real and important gifts that empower meaningful work which benefits people around the world now and tomorrow. </p>
      <p> This document is called a <em> narrative budget. W</em>here most budgets consist of numbers, a <em> narrative </em> budget tells the stories behind the numbers &ndash; your numbers, your donations. This narrative budget tells you where your money goes and how it is used. It is a story to make you proud of every dollar you contribute. It is a story about belonging, about partnership, about good stewardship and about how your faith is made tangible. The story starts with you.</p>
