      <p class="pfirst"> People often leave money to the Anglican Church in wills. Some of this money must be spent in specific ways, according to the donor&rsquo;s request. Much of it is invested. </p>
      <p> About 70 per cent of General Synod&rsquo;s investments are fixed income, such as bonds. The rest consists of equities, such as common stock. </p>
      <p> For a while during the residential schools crisis, this income decreased, but recently the rate of decline has slowed. The church is now looking at ways of once again building up investment funds. To do this, it is finding and implementing innovative programs to increase the size of investments. </p></td>
