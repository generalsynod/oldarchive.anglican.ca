      <p class="sidebar"> Written on the Heart <em> is a video that helps shape Anglican identity. It examines approaches to how Scripture can be studied, how it shapes us, and how we might approach it in the 21st century. </em> Care in Dying <em> is a resource to help families ask the right questions about advanced care of loved ones. </em></p>
      <p class="sidebar"><em> Through Faith, Worship and Ministry, Anglicans participate in dialogue with other denominations. Full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada was promulgated in 2001 and is now a fact of life. Important discussions with Muslims and Jews are ongoing. </em></p>

      <p class="pfirst"> Most of the liturgies, hymn books and prayer books you use each week originated with General Synod&rsquo;s department of Faith, Worship and Ministry. </p>
      <p> This department impacts the everyday lives of Anglicans in many other helpful and vital ways. </p>
      <p> With only five staff members (and the help of committees), Faith, Worship and Ministry delves into ethics, theology, education, youth events, ecumenical and inter-faith dialogue, and translations of resources into other languages. It also participates in the production of educational resources. </p>
      <p> It has produced guidelines to help people make ethical decisions about concerns such as palliative care, reproductive and bio-technology, and sexuality issues. It studies the importance and facilitation of clergy wellness. It is embarking on a study to establish &ldquo;common threads&rdquo; among schools of theological thought. It provides bursaries for theological students and the continuing education of clergy after ordination. </p>
      <p> It is proud of the work it has done translating into French parts of the <em> Book of Alternative Services</em>. It hopes to translate resources into aboriginal languages, and to create bibliographies for discussions of contemporary issues. </p></td>
