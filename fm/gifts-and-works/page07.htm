      <p class="pfirst"> There's a brand-new face to the national offices of the Anglican Church of Canada&rsquo;s General Synod as staff adjust to a modern new building at 80 Hayden Street in Toronto. </p>
      <p> The former offices, at nearby 600 Jarvis Street, were old, dreary, in dire need of repairs, and expensive to operate and maintain. The new offices are much more cost-effective, particularly with decreased heating and cooling expenses. General Synod staff now occupy the first three and a half floors and parts of the basement of a large condominium building. There is adequate staff parking underground. </p>
      <p> In this building, the church collects rent from separately incorporated departments: Pensions, the Anglican Foundation, the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund, and the <em> Anglican Journal</em>. </p>
      <p> In addition to its rental income, and as the church moves forward into a new era of enhanced transparency and accountability, General Synod continues to look for new sources of revenue to cover ever-increasing costs and to implement a new <em> Framework </em> for mission and ministry adopted by General Synod in June 2004. </p>
