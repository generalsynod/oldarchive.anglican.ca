      <p class="pfirst"> This is the business side of the church: the side that pays the bills and staff, and that ensures that the books get audited. It collects revenues from dioceses and makes sure this money is well invested. It looks after building maintenance and manages the books for the Anglican Book Centre as well as the practical requirements of all General Synod departments. It is responsible for overall management. </p>
      <p> Financial Management holds money in trust for the Resolution Corporation, created after the signing of the Residential Schools Agreement with the federal government. It manages estates, annuities and specific legacies as well as grants entrusted to the Council of the North. It administers grants programs provided to overseas partners. The Consolidated Trust Fund receives and manages investments from dioceses and other Anglican organizations. </p>
      <p> Financial Management ensures that money is handled with care, respect, and professional expertise &ndash; the practical sides of good stewardship. </p></td>
