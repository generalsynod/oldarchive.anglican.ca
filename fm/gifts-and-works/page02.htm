      <p class="pfirst"> The work of the church begins the moment a donation is placed in the collection plate. Your diocese uses part of the money you give to pay for the tasks and projects and ministries of General Synod (the formal name by which the working arm of the national Anglican Church of Canada is known.) This money, among other things, helps dioceses in need, particularly in the vast, sparcely populated Canadian North. Some dioceses can (and do) give more than others; some offer what they are able. In general, dioceses are asked to provide to General Synod 26 per cent of their revenue. However, when General Synod provides grants to 11 of Canada&rsquo;s 30 dioceses (the Council of the North), these grants are deducted before the 26 per cent is calculated. </p>
      <p> Your continuing support and faithfulness are greatly valued and appreciated. </p>
