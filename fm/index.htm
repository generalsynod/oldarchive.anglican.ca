    <p>Stewardship and the financial health of the church are essential for it to carry out its mission.</p>
    <p>Financial ministries encourages us to show our faith through financial contributions, by offering our gifts of self, time and money to make a difference in the local and global community. </p>
    <p>General Synod responds to this call, through the Department of Financial Management, the Department of Philanthropy and the Pensions Office Corporation.</p>
    <h2>Financial Management</h2>
    <p><strong>Financial Management</strong> is responsible for a variety of tasks, which include General Synod&rsquo;s financial affairs, payroll and general accounting.</p>
    <p>A key function of the department is the collection of revenue through diocesan proportional gifts and other revenues. </p>
    <p>Financial Management is also the staff group that looks after liaison with Council of the North dioceses and administers the various grant programs. Funds of General Synod, some dioceses and other Anglican organizations are invested in the Consolidated Trust Fund, which is managed by Financial Management. </p>
    <p>Support services such as information technology, mailing, printing and reception for all General Synod departments are provided by Financial Management. </p>
    <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
    <p><a href="giftplanning/index.htm">Gift
      Planning </a> is
      responsible for creating new fundraising initiatives and developing plans
      to support General Synod&rsquo;s ministry and mission. </p>
    <p>Its main programs are the Anglican Appeal, Gift Planning and support for
      dioceses in financial planning and funding.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/appeal">Anglican Appeal</a> is an annual direct mail campaign. It raises 13 per cent of the funds for the mission grants made by the Anglican Church of Canada to support work in northern dioceses and overseas.</p>
    <p>Planned giving allows Canadian Anglicans the opportunity to support the future work of the Anglican church through bequests, life insurance and annuities. Through its regional development program, The Department of Philanthropy facilitates the start-up of planned giving programs in dioceses requesting help. This help includes financial support for diocesan planned giving consultants, supply of resource materials, consulting services and presentation of seminars and programs aimed at increasing awareness of the benefits of planned giving.</p>
<p>The department is committed to providing financial resources for God&rsquo;s work in the 21st century and beyond. </p>
<h2>Pension Office Corporation</h2>
    <p>The Pension Office Corporation administers one pension plan and a number of benefit plans on behalf of the participating employers of these plans.</p>
    <p>The General Synod Pension Plan is a Specified Multi-Employer Plan of which the participating employers include dioceses and other Church-related organizations.</p>
    <p>There is also a Lay Retirement Plan, which is a defined contribution plan.&nbsp; The participating employers of this plan include various parishes and Church-related organizations.&nbsp; The record-keeping and administration of this plan has been outsourced to Canada Life.</p>
    <p>The Pension Office also administers the long-term disability plan and a group employee benefits program.&nbsp; The group benefit plans include coverage for life insurance, extended health, dental and vision care, and short-term disability. The group benefit plans are insured with Manulife.&nbsp; This coverage is open to clergy and lay employees of the member dioceses and organizations.&nbsp; Retiree coverage is also available.</p>
    <p>There is also a Self-Insured Death Benefit that covers active employees for $10,000 and retirees for $4,000.</p>
    <p>The&nbsp; <a href="http://cep.anglican.ca">Continuing Education Plan</a> is also administered by The Pension Office.</p>
