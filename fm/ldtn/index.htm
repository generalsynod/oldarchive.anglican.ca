    <p>It is about stewardship &ndash; about finding the resources and tools with which to do the work that God calls us to do together. </p>
    <p align="left">In 2004, General Synod approved a new plan for the ministry and mission of General Synod; <em>Serving God&rsquo;s World, Strengthening the Church: A Framework for a common journey in</em> <em>Christ.</em> This <em>Framework</em> is a shared vision for growth in ministry and mission across Canada. The challenge of making this vision and the <em>Framework</em> real lies in finding and coordinating the resources for new work along with existing work. This is why the new initiative<em>, Letting Down the Nets,</em> was also approved at the 2004 General Synod as a companion to the <em>Framework</em>.</p>
    <p align="left">The financial resources are available to fund the Anglican church&rsquo;s present and future if we choose to respond intentionally, imaginatively and courageously with a prudent stewardship plan that engages our finest leadership within an effective organization. <em>Letting Down the Nets</em> is a a plan to:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Increase the financial resources of parishes, dioceses and      General Synod and its partners, that are essential for the church&rsquo;s      renewal and its restoration in the wake of the agreement on residential      schools with the deferral government. In order for our church to grow in      membership, faith and service, strong financial support is required at all      levels.</li>
      <li>Raise new funds which the church need to more fully implement      the programs for ministry and mission described in the <em>Framework.</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under the leadership of a steering committee, the <em>Letting Down the Nets</em> initiative operates with four tracks: stewardship; proportional gifts to General Synod; major and planned gifts; and annual appeals. </p>
    <p>What follows is a summary of activities to date in each of these four tracks.</p>
    <p><strong>Stewardship:</strong><br />
      We are working on pilot projects in with six dioceses, initially, through the development of a planning study that assists diocesan leaders in determining a process for the introduction and implementation of a stewardship initiative best suited to that diocese. Upon acceptance of the proposed initiative the LDTN consultants, are assisting diocesan leaders with the provision of resources, training and ongoing monitoring of the initiative. The dioceses currently involved in these pilot projects are; Western Newfoundland; Fredericton; Nova Scotia &amp; PEI; Ottawa; Rupert&rsquo;s Land and Edmonton. </p>
    <p align="left">Because we received requests from more than six dioceses to be considered for pilot projects, we are also assisting a number of other dioceses in various ways, such as in the development of diocesan strategic plans; by providing speakers for stewardship conferences and by providing general resources. We expect that some of these dioceses will eventually become part of the pilot projects.</p>
    <p><strong>Proportional Gifts to General Synod:</strong><br />
      The objective here is to encourage all dioceses to contribute at the minimum level of 26 per cent of diocesan income to support the ministry and mission of General Synod. Working with the treasurer of General Synod, LDTN consultants are taking every opportunity to speak to diocesan synods and other gatherings to promote this concept. We believe that there is a need for a clearer plan relating to the ministry of General Synod that can be communicated more effectively across the country. We are currently working with the Management Team at Church House to produce such a plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Major and Planned Gifts:</strong><br />
      One of our objectives is to ensure that every diocese has at least, the part-time services of a gift-planning officer. This is to expand the ministry that has been in place through the General Synod annual budget for the past 12 years. Assistance is provided to the diocese through partial funding as well as resources. Over the past 12 years tremendous results have been achieved by these gift-planning officers across the country and the more dioceses use this service, the greater will be the benefits for parishes, dioceses and General Synod and its partners.</p>
    <p><strong>Annual Appeals:</strong><br />
      The main focus of this track is to find ways to enhance the existing annual appeals conducted by the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund, the Anglican Appeal, the Anglican Journal and the Anglican Foundation, in addition to seeking ways to develop closer cooperation between these partners.</p>
    <p>To this end an independent study was commissioned and undertaken by Lorna Somers, been received and circulated to appropriate staff. One of the outcomes has been the formation of a task force with the General Secretary as chair and composed of staff involved in the appeals as well as representatives of LDTN.</p>
