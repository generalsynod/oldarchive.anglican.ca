  <h1>From where we sit</h1>
  <h2>diocesan contributions<br />
    $8,550,000</h2>
  <p>This is where it starts: right here, in the pews, with the money you give every Sunday. </p>
  <p>The money is gathered from parish to parish, from diocese to diocese, and it allows the church to continue. It gives life to its very foundation.</p>
  <p>There was not a notable change in diocesan contributions in 2006. Most dioceses are reaching their goals; those that aren&rsquo;t are persevering and intend to &ldquo;get there&rdquo; as soon as they can. One diocese, determined to reach its allotment, gave itself a timeline to accomplish that goal. Some dioceses are beginning to give more than they are asked.</p>
  <p>General Synod&rsquo;s financial development team has been working to become a more visible face to individual parishes and dioceses all across the country. They have traveled to meet with diocesan treasurers and financial committees whenever possible. It is this personal contact that seems to be having the most success in national-diocesan relationships. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;We think we&rsquo;re on the right track,&rdquo; says Financial Management and Development Director Peter Blachford.</p>
  <p>Diocesan contributions will probably be impacted in the future when the renegotiated Residential Schools agreement is implemented. It is still in the courts, but there is hope that when the legal process has run its course, the Anglican Church will get some money back from the government. In that case, it will be used for more healing and reconciliation following the residential school tragedies of abuse.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The fact that dioceses met their commitment to the Residential School fund and also maintained their own work, says Peter Blachford, &ldquo;has been a tremendous accomplishment and a great credit to people in the pews.&rdquo;</em></p>
