  <h1>Launching the circle</h1>
  <h2>general synod provision<br />
    $190,766  </h2>
  <p>When 300 to 500 Anglicans gather at one place in a Canadian city every three years, it can only mean one thing: <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/gs2007">General Synod</a>.</p>
  <p>This year, General Synod will be held in Winnipeg at three locations: the Radisson and Ramada Marlborough hotels and Holy Trinity Anglican Church. All are downtown and within walking distance of each other.</p>
  <p>The theme, decided by the Council of General Synod, is visual as well as philosophical: <em>Draw the Circle Wide&hellip;Draw it Wider Still</em>.</p>
  <p>Every year, money is set aside for this critical event. It is called General Synod Provision.</p>
  <p>Margaret Shawyer and Dianne Izzard have been working towards General Synod in Winnipeg since the last one ended three years ago in St. Catharines, Ont. It is a never-ending job. </p>
  <p>But a General Synod year is the busiest of all. The planners must think of every detail from accommodation to how people get to and from the airport. They must be sure everyone gets fed, everyone has the necessary documents, and that the meeting rooms are ready. They must keep everything meticulously recorded and distributed before, during and after the event.</p>
  <p>This year General Synod will say goodbye to the primate it elected in St. Catharines and welcome someone it will choose in Winnipeg. There will be many challenging items for discussion and decision. The behind-the-scenes work of staff and the General Synod Planning Committee ensures delegates, guests and visitors can devote themselves to the business at hand.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Over the past three years, members of the General Synod Planning Committee, chaired by Dean Peter Wall of the diocese of Niagara, have worked with the local arrangements committee and the General Synod Worship Committee to make sure General Synod in Winnipeg accommodates everyone and allows each to attend to the&nbsp; serious issues the church faces. The committees have had to think about each bishop, clergy and lay delegate from across the country. They have had to make sure technology is in place and that all participants can do their work efficiently, safely and effectively.</em></p>
