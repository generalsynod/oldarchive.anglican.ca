  <h1>Walking the healing path </h1>
  <h2>INDIGENOUS MINISTRIES<br />
  $467,873</h2>
  <p>When Mark MacDonald became the church&rsquo;s first National Indigenous Bishop at the beginning of this year, it was a turning point in the long, emotional relationship between the Anglican church and Canada&rsquo;s aboriginal peoples.</p>
  <p>Following Bishop MacDonald&rsquo;s appointment, Indigenous Ministries, once part of the Partnerships Department, became a separate entity, still funded by General Synod.</p>
  <p>Indigenous Ministries is headed by Bishop MacDonald. Donna Bomberry continues as the full-time coordinator. Teresa Mandricks is a half-time program associate.</p>
  <p>The department works to support indigenous people in the Anglican Church of Canada but also in the wider Canadian community. It will establish elders&rsquo; advisory and youth advisory circles to work with Bishop MacDonald; the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/committees/acip/">Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples</a> will continue in its advisory role as well.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The road to healing between Canada&rsquo;s aboriginal peoples and the Anglican Church of Canada began in 1967 with Beyond Traplines, a report by Charles Hendry, a sociologist who was commissioned by the church to do an in-depth study of the history and relationship between the two groups. The report was a painful eye-opener as well as an instructive document that ultimately led to the start of healing and reconciliation, beginning with a public church apology (in 1993) to Residential School survivors.</em></p>
