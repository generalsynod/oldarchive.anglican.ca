  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Every budget tells a tale, in factual numbers, of how resources are received and then used up. Although this accountant&rsquo;s tool tells an important story, it does not demonstrate challenges faced or the tremendous strength required to successfully capitalize on opportunities. This <em>Narrative Budget</em> for 2007 attempts to explain to you whose church this is and whose servant General Synod is, where we have been, what we have experienced, and where we hope to go. This is the story behind the numbers. </p>
  <p>It has been said that no one can predict the future with certainty. We can look at the past, can study performance and can anticipate based on experience. And from all that, perhaps we can get a relatively good idea of what tomorrow might look like. </p>
  <p>In response to this ever-changing world, it is essential to continually review both what we are doing and how we are doing it. As the Anglican Church of Canada continues its journey, we must understand both our strengths and our weaknesses. We must face up to threats and challenges, and learn to see these as opportunities. We must affirm our shared love of the church and embrace together the challenges that tomorrow will bring.</p>
  <p>We know the strength that lies within all of us: within congregations and parishes, dioceses and individuals. There is strength in renewed church leadership across our country. We have witnessed strength in your increasing support of the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/appeal">Anglican Appeal</a>, the <em><a href="http://www.anglicanjournal.com/">Anglican Journal</a></em>, <a href="http://www.anglicanfoundation.org/">The Anglican Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.pwrdf.org/">Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund</a>. We have seen the imagination and enthusiasm that the whole church revealed in meeting itscommitment to the Residential Schools Settlement Fund.</p>
  <p>We know our weaknesses, too. Our congregations are aging and shrinking. Asset bases of both the General Synod and the dioceses have been eroded, providing less investment income. In addition to the continuing needs for ongoing reconciliation and healing related to the residential schools issue, other matters such as the blessing of same-sex unions, church governance and our place in the world-wide Anglican Communion, threaten to divide us, to compromise our solidarity and potentially to affect our financial stability.</p>
  <p>While we are, for the most part, an aging population, many of us are &ldquo;baby-boomers.&rdquo;&nbsp; We grew up in a relatively privileged world. We married, worked and had children. We built up some wealth. Now we are retiring. We have resources to give. Although the task of maintaining our church is more challenging for us than it was for our grandparents, because of our age and experience, we know how to ride through difficult times. We know, in fact, that difficult times often spark creative and innovative solutions. </p>
  <h3><strong>the way we were </strong><strong>(2006)</strong></h3>
  <p>When the 2006 budget was approved, it balanced revenues and expenses for the year. This &ldquo;break-even&rdquo; budget was the result of significant expenditure reductions made across all operations of the General Synod, and was based on specific assumptions. While many of these assumptions proved to be well founded, one did not. </p>
  <p>Rather than making the budgeted marginal profit or at least breaking-even, early indications are that the <a href="http://www.anglicanbookcentre.com/">Anglican Book Centre</a> incurred another significant loss in 2006. In spite of substantial expense reductions implemented in the fall of 2005 and constant monitoring during 2006, <acronym title="Anglican Book Centre">ABC</acronym> gross sales figures continued to slide throughout 2006. In the fall of 2006, the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/COGS/index.htm">Council of General Synod</a> looked at continuing sales decline and deficits and approved the closing of the <acronym title="Anglican Book Centre">ABC</acronym> retail store and the transformation of Anglican Book Centre into a web/telephone/mail order based business. The council also asked for further investigation of the possibility of ecumenical partners collaborating with the General Synod, to find a solution that would keep the ABC retail store open. </p>
  <h3><strong>a way forward </strong><strong>(2007)</strong></h3>
  <p>Although the proposed budget for 2007 is balanced, it will be a difficult year. There will be sacrifices and unforeseen obstacles. Departments of General Synod will all feel the pinch of reduced funding. </p>
  <p>General Synod revenue for 2007 will be approximately 3 per cent less than the approved budget of 2006. While there are some fluctuations in the various income categories, the major decrease in expected revenue relates to what is anticipated from undesignated legacies to both the General Synod and to the Anglican Appeal. Due to the unpredictable nature of this source of revenue, best accounting practice suggests that this potential source of revenue should not be relied on to ensure that the budget balances in any given year. It is better to use the funds received in any given year, to fund expenditures the following year.</p>
  <p>In a perfect world, to work within these revenue decreases, the overall General Synod expenses would be cut by approximately $255,000, to produce a balanced budget for 2007. Therefore, each department of General Synod was subjected to a thorough review of all expenditures. While some expenses were significantly reduced, we are also affected by cost increases beyond our control. The most notable of these increases related to depreciation and realty tax expenses, now that we have taken ownership of our 80 Hayden Street offices. </p>
  <p>Accordingly, in order to produce a balanced budget for 2007, it was necessary bring in capital revenue relating to the move from our old building to our new premises. When the negotiations were completed relating to the sale of our old building at 600 Jarvis Street, the General Synod was awarded an &ldquo;option&rdquo; that entitled us to ground level, retail space in the phase II redevelopment of the old 600 Jarvis Street lands, plus an additional five condominium parking spots. With the Council of General Synod decision to close the retail section of the Anglican Book Centre, we no longer need this retail space. In lieu of exercising this option, the General Synod is entitled to a cash payment of $425,000. This will be used to balance the 2007 budget. </p>
  <h3><strong>collaborative partnership</strong></h3>
  <p>The Anglican church has been around longer than any of us can remember. It has been part of the lives of many Canadians since they were born. Like any institution that has existed this long, it has been part of countless social transitions. It has witnessed profound changes both within its own ranks, and beyond. It will undoubtedly face more challenges as society continues to develop in different ways.</p>
  <p>It has been extremely difficult to present this balanced budget for 2007. All of us, from General Synod staff to the Council of the North, dioceses and parishes, have been affected by downsizing and new priorities. Resources are stretched to the breaking point.</p>
  <p>2007 will be another year of continuing change with our General Synod meeting in Winnipeg, the recent appointment of Bishop Mark MacDonald as the church&rsquo;s first National Indigenous Bishop and the election of a new Primate. In order to progress, we must honor the principles of accountability, transparency, clarity and communication. </p>
  <p>This is a balanced budget. But there is no room for contingency. It will require experienced and prudent oversight.</p>
  <p>With your patience, gifts, and prayers, I know we will succeed.</p>
