  <h1>A most essential cog</h1>
  <h2>GENERAL SECRETARY<br />$545,040</h2>
  <p>To people in the office of the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/General-Secretary/index.htm">General Secretary</a>, a <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/gs2007/">General Synod year</a> must seem like a marathon. For Archdeacon Michael Pollesel, who faces it as General Secretary for the first time, it must also feel like a milestone. </p>
  <p> Appointed to the job at the end of 2005, Archdeacon Pollesel took over the work of the retired Jim Boyles and Dr. Ellie Johnson last February. (Dr. Johnson was Acting General Secretary until Archdeacon Pollesel arrived from the diocese of Ontario.) The new General Secretary works with six full-time and part-time staff members. He is the chief operating officer for Church House. He oversees General Synod <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/committees/index.htm">committees, councils, boards and commissions</a>. He is responsible for the planning of General Synod and its council. He assists the primate, watches over the day-to-day operations of Church House in Toronto, and meets regularly with <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/index.htm">department</a> directors. </p>
  <p> It&rsquo;s a huge job and to most people it must seem overwhelming. A dedicated and knowledgeable staff, however, make the General Secretary&rsquo;s work not only possible but efficient and effective. </p>
  <p> The office of the General Secretary is responsible for <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/General-Secretary/archives/index.htm">national archives</a>, where church records, historic documents, books and artifacts are catalogued and preserved. </p>
  <p>The section, headed by Nancy Hurn and assisted by Laurel Parson, also includes the archives of the diocese of the Arctic, the Anglican Foundation, and the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund. </p>
  <p>Tammy Wesley, who provides administrative support for Residential School litigation, joined the General Secretary&rsquo;s staff at the end of 2006. She looks after the claims process in Residential Schools litigation and attends Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) hearings. This year she organized a large gathering in Banff, Alberta for people who represent the Anglican church at ADR hearings.</p>
  <p> Ann Odorico, a human resources consultant, supports and helps national office staff. Her work also includes recruitment and staffing for management; issues of health, safety, disability, and employee relations; and training and development. She looks after performance concerns, job evaluation and employee records.</p>
