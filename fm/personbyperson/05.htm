  <h2><acronym title="Anglican Book Centre">ABC</acronym> MERCHANDISING AND DISTRIBUTION<br />ABC Consolidated $15,600</h2>
  <p>It has been a tough time for the well-respected <a href="https://www.anglicanbookcentre.com/">Anglican Book Centre</a>. It had been steadily losing money; staff had to be let go; and finally this year the decision was made at <acronym title="Council of General Synod"><a href="https://www.anglican.ca/about/COGS/index.htm">CoGS</a></acronym> to close the store. </p>
  <p>However, after much sadness and emotional ups and downs for customers as well as staff, the book centre may yet survive, in another form.</p>
  <p>Serious negotiations are under way with Augsburg Fortress Canada which would see a retail operation continue at the present location under the old, venerable name &mdash; <acronym title="Anglican Book Centre">ABC</acronym>.</p>
  <p>It is not how the church originally envisioned its book outlet, but it is a solid alternative that ensures the continuation of a prized ministry. Anglican Book Centre web and mail-order sales will also continue in a new form, but now distribution will be better and faster.</p>
  <p>General Synod&rsquo;s Financial Management and Development Director, Peter Blachford, says it is interesting to note what can come out of seemingly bleak times when the motivataion for new ways of thinking and working are there. He added that <acronym title="Anglican Book Centre">ABC</acronym>&rsquo;s difficulties have been profoundly stressful for staff and their tenacity is deeply appreciated.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Many <acronym title="Anglican Book Centre">ABC</acronym> customers find that Internet sales of their favorite books and resources are helpful and convenient. Although they may miss the experience of browsing through the store, they also know they can order what they want at any time of the day or night, and in any kind of weather. It&rsquo;s a new world, and it takes some adjustment. And yet there are benefits we might not have considered in the &ldquo;old&rdquo; way of doing things.</em></p>
