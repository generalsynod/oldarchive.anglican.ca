  <h1>For Canada and the world </h1>
  <h2>PARTNERSHIPS<br />
  $1,969,894</h2>
  <p>Change can be invigorating. It can also be challenging. But <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/partnerships/index.htm">Partnerships</a> carries on through thick and thin, through budget cuts and transitions. It is a dynamic group doing essential work in Canada and around the world.</p>
  <p>There is a new section in the budget for Partnerships for 2007. It&rsquo;s called Healing and Reconciliation. It covers anti-racism. It looks after alternative dispute resolution and individual assessment programs for former residential school students. It will participate in the government&rsquo;s proposed Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission also addresses the legacy of residential schools.</p>
  <p>In addition to this important work, the healing and reconciliation budget allotment will go towards projects that are still to emerge &mdash; for instance, extra staffing for the digitalization and documentation of photographs. These photographs are important for former residential school students who must validate claims they did in fact attend the schools.</p>
  <p>There have been other changes in Partnerships.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.anglican.ca/partnerships/PIM/index.htm">Partners in Mission</a> has been reduced and reorganized into two sections: Global Relations and Mission Education and Personnel. Global Relations staff Andrea Mann and Claudia Alvarez maintain the church&rsquo;s international and ecumenical relationships. Global Relations also allocates grants to partner churches and organizations, although the money available for that is less than it was in 2006.</p>
  <p>Mission Education and Personnel staff Jill Cruse and Clementina Thomas look after <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/partnerships/VIM/">Volunteers in Mission</a>, the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/partnerships/PIM/TSIP/index.htm">Student International Internship Program</a>, and the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/partnerships/cdp.htm">Companion Diocese Program</a>. </p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.accnotes.org/ecojustice/">EcoJustice</a> section of Partnerships, with Maylanne Maybee and Lydia Laku, provides leadership to the church&rsquo;s work in critical areas of ecological, economic and social justice. The successful <a href="http://www.justicecamp.org/">Justice Camps</a> fall within this section and with the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/committees/ejc.htm">EcoJustice Committee</a>.</p>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/Residental-Schools/healing/index.htm">Indigenous Healing Fund</a> has changed. It is no longer funded within the General Synod budget. It now falls under the Residential Schools Settlement Fund. Staffed by Esther Wesley and Teresa Mandricks, this fund has been renamed The Anglican Fund for Healing and Reconciliation.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>EcoJustice committee members are enthusiastic&nbsp; about Justice Camps for youth and young adults (18 years and up). The first two have been successful, and a third is coming up this year. In Winnipeg in 2005, the camp&rsquo;s theme was food justice. Young people studied and reflected on the economic, ecological, community, and faith dimensions of food and agriculture. Last year&rsquo;s camp in Ottawa looked at advocacy, with 63 participants from coast to coast. The next one, hosted by the diocese of British Columbia in Victoria this summer, will dwell on ecology. The camps are so popular and fill up so fast that people must be turned away. This year the camp can take 70. Participants know it is a working camp and they will immerse themselves in experiences related to the theme &ndash; &ldquo;to get their hands dirty, to reflect theologically, and also to have fun&rdquo;, says the website: <a href="http://www.justicecamp.org">www.justicecamp.org</a>.</em></p>
