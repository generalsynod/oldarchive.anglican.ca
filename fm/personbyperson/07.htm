  <h1>Pastor for the whole church</h1>
  <h2>THE PRIMATE&rsquo;S OFFICE<br />
  $392,900</h2>
  <p>Her name was Emily. She was about 6 years old. She wanted to give the new primate a card she had made.&nbsp; It was 2004, and <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/primate/index.htm">Archbishop Andrew Hutchison</a> had just been elected. </p>
  <p>The card gave him instructions for the things he was to do in his new role. &ldquo;Teach the bible,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Be nice to people. And have fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In June, Archbishop Hutchison, Primate for the past three years, will retire. He says that he has indeed had fun as well as countless experiences. He didn&rsquo;t change the world, but he knew from the start that&rsquo;s how it would be. </p>
  <p>When he was elected, he made up his mind about a few things.&nbsp; He knew he&rsquo;d concentrate on reconciliation. He knew he&rsquo;d pay attention to communication. He knew he&rsquo;d celebrate the church&rsquo;s youth.</p>
  <p>His principal secretary, Archdeacon Paul Feheley, says that the primate was deeply inspired by St. Paul&rsquo;s words, which remind Christians about their duty to reconcile, to be peacemakers (2 Corinthians 5-18). </p>
  <p>He was a reconciler when he worked towards improving relationships with the aboriginal community, and when he appointed the first indigenous bishop. He was a reconciler when he insisted on having all voices heard, especially during these challenging times. </p>
  <p>He showed this in his enthusiasm for meeting people of all theological and philosophical outlooks. He traveled to parishes in every diocese in Canada and to all Anglican seminaries and theological colleges. He met with homosexual and former homosexual people, and with the group Essentials. He met with unhappy parishes. </p>
  <p>And he listened. &ldquo;He saw his role as pastor for the whole church,&rdquo; says Archdeacon Feheley, &ldquo;and his job as a ministry of presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The primate was the host of a webcast in which he shared ideas and invited feedback from Anglicans and non-Anglicans. </p>
  <p>He also became a &ldquo;blogger&rdquo; on the <em><a href="http://generation.anglican.ca">generation.anglican.ca</a></em> website. Since there was &ldquo;not significant money&rdquo; for Anglican youth, the primate saw a website for young Canadian Anglicans as a natural way to connect with youth. The website was funded in part by the primate&rsquo;s annual dinner. &ldquo;Kids all over the world are accessing it,&rdquo; says Archdeacon Feheley. </p>
  <p>Now the challenge will be to keep the website going. Archbishop Hutchison hopes its cost will move into the regular budget.</p>
  <p>The next years will continue to be stressful for Archbishop Hutchison&rsquo;s successor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; any more,&rdquo; says Archdeacon Feheley. The new primate will need &ldquo;wisdom and leadership for a changing church in a changing world.&rdquo;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Archbishop Andrew Hutchison enjoys meeting people everywhere. One day he attended a luncheon with some ex-cons at an old stone church in Saint John, New Brunswick. Normally expected to lead in prayer, he was touched when one of the ex-cons, a particularly tough-looking fellow, tattoos and all, commanded the attention of the room. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna stand,&rdquo; he told his colleagues. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna pray for Andrew. And then we&rsquo;re gonna bless him.&rdquo; The archbishop says that during his three-year ministry as Primate, moments like that were among the most tender and memorable.</em></p>
