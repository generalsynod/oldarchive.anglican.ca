    Total:

  <p>Anglicans are generous by nature. You only have to look at the amount of money they donate through the church&rsquo;s Gift Planning program.</p>
  <p>In the past 12 years about $40 million has been raised through General Synod&rsquo;s gift planning consultants and another $15 in charitable gift annuities. Much of the gift annuities are designated for parishes, the Anglican Foundation, and The Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund. </p>
  <p>That&rsquo;s good news. Even better news is that it keeps growing. Each year there is an increase in bequests, gift annuities, gifts of life insurance and listed securities. Donors know where they want their gifts to go &mdash; mostly for ministry and program rather than for capital projects.</p>
  <p>Funding for the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/plannedgiving">Planned Giving</a> program comes from the Office of Financial Development for General Synod, from particular dioceses, and with seed money from <em><a href="http://www.anglican.ca/fm/ldtn/">Letting Down the Nets</a></em>, a program for stewardship and stewardship education.</p>
  <p>Archdeacon John Robertson is the National Gift Planning Officer. He spends a third of his time travelling to dioceses and parishes throughout Canada. When he&rsquo;s not doing that, he works at his offices in Kingston and Toronto. This is where he prepares annuity and other agreements, processes gifts of listed securities and responds to special inquiries about gift planning or stewardship education. He also prepares resource material and visits donors.</p>
  <p> He is encouraged by the increase in inquiries following news of a resolution of the Residential Schools litigation and by the response to new gift planning brochures and guides, including the <em>Anglican Investment Plan </em>for insurable people between the ages of 65 and 75. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>The team of professional gift planning consultants is large and growing. So far there are 11 who serve dioceses and regions of the church. Dioceses employ five more who focus on stewardship education. As of early this year, there are two new positions serving the dioceses of Kootenay and Huron. It&rsquo;s looking as though there will be a gift planning consultant available to every diocese in Canada in just two or three years.</em></p>
