  <p>Creative thinking means more than telling the stories of our church.</p>
  <p>In the department of <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/CIR/index.htm">Communications and Information Resources</a> (CIR), it also means doing the best with what you have. It means concentrating your ideas and energies on possibilities and challenges rather than cutbacks.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s a different world for the church in these times of budget restraint, and this department feels it just as all the others do and more. Along with Partnerships, CIR bore the brunt of most of last year&rsquo;s budget cuts.</p>
  <p>In 2007 the publication <em><a href="http://generalsynod.anglican.ca/ministries/departments/mm/">Ministry</a></em><a href="http://generalsynod.anglican.ca/ministries/departments/mm/">Matters</a> had to be suspended. Funding for resource production and media relations was severely cut &mdash; a difficult thing to have to cope with in a General Synod year. Two critical positions &mdash; Assistant to the Director of CIR and <em>Anglican Journal</em> Editorial Assistant &ndash; were merged into one. This year there will be no Communications assistant/Web writer.</p>
  <p>However, life goes on and staff are finding ways to get the job done even though their means are limited, and even in a General Synod year, when demands for information and resources are at their highest.</p>
  <p>It means working more closely with others. Sometimes joining forces with another department (one that can bear the cost) allows CIR to produce a new resource.</p>
  <p>Modern technology helps when so many people now use the Internet. CIR is developing a major information package for media attending General Synod in June. Volunteers and staff are also pitching in to produce this material. It is the work a Communications assistant/Web writer would normally do.</p>
  <p>Despite cutbacks, <em><a href="http://www.anglicanjournal.com">Anglican Journal</a></em> still produces an award-winning newspaper and also launched a new website last year. The department reformatted the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/conversations/">primate&rsquo;s webcast</a>. It re-designed the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/index.htm">home page</a> of the General Synod web site. The <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/CIR/library.htm">Library</a> is still there as a front-line ministry for people with questions and <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/about/departments/CIR/video/index.htm">Anglican Video</a>, once again, is playing a key role in preparations for General Synod.</p>
  <p>The most important job, in spite of vastly diminished resources, is to tell the stories of the church and to deliver them to Anglicans and the world. This year the biggest challenge is General Synod. CIR is producing one resource: a <em>Faces and Ministries</em> publication &mdash; the third edition &mdash; that explores the work of General Synod and highlights the efforts of its seemingly tireless staff.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>In crisis and in tough times, people often show their sturdiest sides. It&rsquo;s often when they spring forth with new projects or new ideas and surprise even themselves with their resilience. In some ways, CIR has been like that. Despite obstacles, it still managed last year to produce a narrative budget as well as resources on the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples and the new National Indigenous Bishop. It instigated Facing AIDS, Facing Reality, a photo exhibit of the Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund that, by the time it reaches General Synod in Winnipeg, will have traveled to every diocese throughout Canada. It was also part of the International AIDS Conference in Toronto last August. CIR fully intends to continue to find new ways of communicating so the church and its people remain connected, proud, productive and hopeful. </em></p>
