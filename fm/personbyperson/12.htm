  <h1>Vital, brave, steadfast </h1>
  <h2>COUNCIL OF THE NORTH GRANTS<br />
  $2,373,413</h2>
  <p>They&rsquo;re resilient, determined and resourceful. Maybe it&rsquo;s the cold weather and other harsh conditions that keep members of the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/cn">Council of the North</a> strong.</p>
  <p> General Synod&rsquo;s grant to the council will remain the same in 2007 and 2008, even though the cost of living in the North continues to grow.</p>
  <p> Despite this, some dioceses are already planning for self-sufficiency. The diocese of Quebec, in the northern part of the province, aims to achieve this in five years. It hopes that its share of General Synod grants will then go back into the pot for other northern dioceses.</p>
  <p> The Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior (formerly the diocese of Cariboo) hopes for a 5 per cent reduction; the diocese of Athabasca is also working towards self-sufficiency.</p>
  <p> The Council of the North continues to struggle. Life&nbsp; in these areas &mdash; the Arctic, Yukon, Northern and Central Interior British Columbia, Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, northern Ontario, northern Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador &mdash; gets tougher and tougher as prices rise. But the work goes on. Non-stipendiary personnel increasingly put in more hours. And yet, Council of the North clergy and congregations love their people, their land and their church. They carry on even in the face of tough obstacles.</p>
  <p> Your money helps to keep this vital, brave and steadfast ministry alive despite its many challenges. Members of the council depend on you to do their work in circumstances many of us wouldn&rsquo;t or couldn&rsquo;t endure.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>When Rev. Susan Titterington goes to Old Crow at the northern tip of The Yukon, she is Gikhyi, one who speaks the Word of God. She lives with her husband in Dawson City and often travels in a small plane to Old Crow, where she is a priest among the First Nations community. Sometimes she takes trips along the Porcupine River to Tlo Kut, a sacred gathering place and also a science camp for young Yukon women. It&rsquo;s about 45 minutes outside of Old Crow. In Dawson, Susan&rsquo;s ministry includes worship, support to the local deacon, training and equipping for ministry. This is just one aspect of life for people embraced by the Council of the North. It is an area of the church&rsquo;s work that is assisted by your donations to <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/appeal/">Anglican Appeal</a>.</em></p>
