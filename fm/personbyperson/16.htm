  <h1>A stronger sense of purpose</h1>
  <h2 align="left">house of bishops</h2>
  <h2 align="left">$160,400 </h2>
  <p>Bishops are a particular sort. They have big jobs, big responsibilities, and with those come big stresses. </p>
  <p>And so, when they get together twice a year from all across Canada, it&rsquo;s a much-needed time to chat, explore, listen, study, and review the issues before the church.</p>
  <p>The issues have been difficult in recent years, and tough times can take their toll. </p>
  <p>When Archbishop Andrew Hutchison was elected primate in 2004, he was determined to bring unity and solidarity to this group of church leaders.</p>
  <p>Now that he is retiring, he feels he has met that goal &ndash; that his leaderships has lead to more empathy and a stronger sense of unified purpose within the House of Bishops. He calls it a new era of &ldquo;relationships and trust&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The House of Bishops will meet this year in April and October.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><em>Archbishop Hutchison explained the impact of his meetings with the House of Bishops on a &ldquo;blog&rdquo; he wrote for the <a href="http://generation.anglican.ca">generation.anglican.ca</a>&nbsp; website for young Canadian Anglicans:</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;When the bishops meet,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;it is a time of a great deal of conversation and fellowship. In many ways I think the bishops are their most human during these meetings. We dress casually, share in food and drinks, have a time of bible study each day and work at the issues always with a sense of Christ&rsquo;s presence among us. We don&rsquo;t always agree; in fact, we frequently disagree; but the respect each has of the other is very high and so we work through the issues aiming towards consensus.&rdquo;</em></p>
