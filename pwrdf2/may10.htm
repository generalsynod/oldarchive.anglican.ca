    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">On April 24, Fr. Oscar Enriquez Perez, founder and director of PWRDF partner organization, the Paso del Norte Human Rights Centre in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, M&eacute;xico, received the sixth annual Voice of the Voiceless Award.&nbsp; The award was presented to Fr. Enriquez by Annunciation House, a migrant and refugee serving agency across the border from Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez,&nbsp; in El Paso, Texas.&nbsp; The award recognized the work of Fr. Enriquez and the Centre &ldquo;on behalf of the voiceless victims of violence in Ju&aacute;rez&rdquo; where a bloody drug war has claimed the lives of over 5,000 individuals since it began in January 2008.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF sent a message to Fr. Enriquez, congratulating him on receiving the award.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his response, Fr. Enriquez noted that the recognition, together with the award ceremony &ldquo;was a stimulus for me to intensify my option for the victims of violence and to strengthen my commitment to the poor.&nbsp; The recognition was for the whole Centre.&rdquo;&nbsp; Please pray for Fr. Enriquez and the staff of the Centre who risk their own lives to defend those whom they serve in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez.    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Feeling the Winds of God: Charting a New Course.</em></p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Under this theme, the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada is meeting at St. Mary&rsquo;s University in Halifax this June. PWRDF staff and volunteers will be present and joining them is </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Sooriyakumary Sinnathanby, PWRDF partner from OfFER (Organization for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation) Ceylon. Along with observing the sessions and discussions in plenary, visiting the displays area and meeting old friends and making new ones, we will be wrapping up our 18 month celebration of PWRDF&rsquo;s 50th anniversary program. And what a joyful 18 months it has been. Celebration, awareness, fundraising and education were the goals and we have reached them in a variety of ways. To commemorate PWRDF&rsquo;s &lsquo;birth&rsquo; day, September 7, 1959, Anglicans participated in a hymn writing contest, produced a double CD, One Voice, enrolled in a 50 Leaders for the Anglican Church of Canada program, held local and regional fundraising events and enlivened the work of PWRDF in ways that will carry us through the next 50 years. The 50 Refugees Sponsorship initiative is more than half way there and may even surpass the goal. We give thanks for the energy and enthusiasm of Canadian Anglicans that has come to us through the 50th anniversary programs.

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">World Week for Peace in Israel-Palestine, May 29 to June 4 2010</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">For more than 40 years, Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem have been suffering under the Israeli occupation. Day-to-day life is interrupted by the separation wall, checkpoints, house demolitions, ever-expanding settlements, land seizures and inequitable water use policies. Human rights are denied through arbitrary arrests and an intricate web of bureaucratic rules and regulations limiting the most basic of freedoms. Israeli military actions and Palestinian attacks have caused far too many deaths and both sides live in uncertainty and fear. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In a time when hope seems all but gone, KAIROS joins the World Council of Churches in its worldwide call and invites congregations to take part in the World Week for Peace in Palestine Israel between May 29 and June 4, 2010. Join churches around the world in prayer and action for peace for Palestinians and Israelis.
