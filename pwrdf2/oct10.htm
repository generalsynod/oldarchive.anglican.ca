      World AIDS Day, December 1, 2010</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>AVERT.ORG </strong><br>
    Started on 1st December 1988, World AIDS Day is about raising money, increasing awareness, fighting prejudice and improving education. The World AIDS Day theme for 2010 is <em>'Universal Access and Human Rights'</em>. World AIDS Day is important in reminding people that HIV has not gone away and that there are many things still to be done.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">According to UNAIDS estimates, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, including 2.1 million children. During 2008 some 2.7 million people became newly infected with the virus and an estimated 2 million people died from AIDS. Around half of all people who become infected with HIV do so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35. The vast majority of people with HIV and AIDS live in lower and middle income countries. But HIV today is a threat to men, women and children on all continents around the world.</p>

    </strong>Lulu Boxoza and Temba House in Mthatha, South Africa are PWRDF partners in the struggleagainst HIV and AIDS and their work has shown that love, education and good nutrition go a long way to saving lives and loving our neighbours as ourselves. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">My name is Vuyokazi Khenyane. I was born on April 12, 1973 and I live in Mpeko Location, Mthatha, South Africa. I was diagnosed as being HIV Positive on February 2, 2000. When the doctor broke this news to me, I was shocked and fell into a state of depression. A severe case of Herpes Zoster below my left breast caused me to become very weak and this only made my situation worse.<a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews[year]=2010&tx_ttnews[month]=02&tx_ttnews[day]=14&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=706&tx_ttnews[backPid]=114&cHash=182413e4f294e2cd1de02df6d510cec2">Read more</a>    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">A victory! On November 12 the federal government announced that Canada will endorse the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This reverses its previous position, and means that Canada is no longer one of only two countries that have refused to endorse the Declaration. Now what? Is the campaign over? </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong><em>The KAIROS campaign in support of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples will continue; so will the December 5 drumming day.</em></strong> From the beginning, KAIROS asked that the government both endorse and implement the Declaration. The first part is done, but the second part is a greater challenge. We invite everyone to shift your efforts to holding the government accountable for truly living out the Declaration. While the federal government’s actions are key to making the Declaration more than a piece of paper, there is much we can do in our own communities to make the Declaration a living commitment. Our December 5 <em>Beat the Drum</em> action is but one suggestion. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong><em>What’s next?</em></strong> KAIROS is changing and re-releasing the <strong><em>campaign petition </em></strong>because part of its request is no longer valid. We thank everyone who signed it, and we’ll ensure that the government hears about the number of people who did. When the revised petition is available, please put it out to your community. It will be posted <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=1030803189&msgid=1938998&act=7M7C&c=415951&destination=http%3A//www.kairoscanada.org/en/take-action/the-land-our-life/">here</a> when ready. We’ll be updating the very popular quiz show, <em>UNDRIPardy</em>, available on CD or as a free download on our website. We are also working on materials that will explain what implementation of the Declaration would look like.

CFGB Food Justice Network: Send a Message to Ottawa to Put Hungry People First with Canada's Climate Change Financing</strong></h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Canada committed $400 million in 2010 to assist developing countries cope with climate change. Right now, the Environment Minister is deciding how to spend next year's allotment. In 2010 most of Canada's money went as loans through the World Bank to finance clean energy projects (mitigation). Only 11% of the $400 million to help vulnerable people, such as small-scale farmers, adapt to climate change. According to an international agreement, Canada should balance the funding between mitigation and adaptation. Clearly we need to remind our government of this.<br>
      More money for adaptation. Grants not loans. Money will be well-spent if it goes to help those who are most affected by climate change. It should also be given as grants, and shouldn't take away from existing aid budgets. We expect the decision to be made before January 1st, 2011.<em><strong> </strong></em><em>Now is the time to write a letter to your MP. </em></p>

The Reps. were joined by members of the PWRDF Youth Council, PWRDF Board members, PWRDF staff and Parish Representatives from the Diocese of Calgary. Highlights of the event included an excellent presentation on Partnership and Development in Africa by William Ogara, long-time PWRDF Board member from Kenya, and a visit to the Siksika First Nation Community College, a former residential school. The group was hosted in Siksika by Vivian Ayoungman, also a PWRDF Board member. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The PWRDF Board of Directors gathered at Church House in Toronto from November 4-6 for their twice annual meeting, as well as for the Annual General Meeting of the organization. During a lively and productive meeting the Board adopted the Vision and Mission developed through the Branding process. The &ldquo;vision&rdquo; reads: &ldquo;A truly just, healthy and peaceful world.&rdquo; And the strategic themes were expanded from three to four in order to speak to environmental issues:</p>
    <ul  style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.625em;">
      <li>Promoting a global culture of peace with justice</li>
      <li>Building a moral economy</li>
      <li>Accompanying communities in crisis</li>
      <li>Healing Mother Earth</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In addition two committees were established for Strategic Planning and Governance with specific tasks, mandates and recommendations to be brought to the next Board of Directors meeting in May 2011.    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In early November, partner Geoffrey Monjesa from the Diocese of Masasi in Tanzania visited the PWRDF offices briefly at the end of a month-long visit to Canada together with his bishop, Patrick Mwachiko and Bishop Patrick’s wife. Although this was his first visit, PWRDF staff commented that we felt we already knew him well through the cheerful and rather loud telephone conversations that former PWRDF staff-member, Glen Spurrell had had with him on a regular basis! Geoffrey brought with him images and news of a thriving health and food security program that has benefitted from a significant injection of funds through PWRDF’s CIDA program, as well as from the Canadian Food Grains Bank (CFGB). He noted that the scale of the project has been such that the diocesan development program has been able to achieve in three years what in the past would have taken ten.    </p>
