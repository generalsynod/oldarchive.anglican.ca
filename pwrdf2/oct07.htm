        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) recently charged the Canadian government with undermining the refugee claim system by creating a rapidly growing backlog through its continuing failure to appoint sufficient decision makers. That there is a growing backlog claim system is not news to many Canadians. Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), a quasi-judicial tribunal that decides the fate of refugee claimants, has been facing this problem for the last couple of years.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">At the end of 2005, there were 20,552 claims pending, since then the number of claims have increased to over 30,000. The issue is becoming critical as there are a few officers available to deal with the claims. According to a CCR press release, &quot;The Refugee Protection Division of the IRB should have 127 members, but because of government failure to appoint and re-appoint, it is short 46 members.&quot; </p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The backlog is a concern because refugees' lives are on hold until a decision is made on regarding their status. <strong>For more information visit <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.ccrweb.ca/">www.ccrweb.ca</a></strong></p>

        </h3>
        
          <li><strong>Canada-Mexico Relationship: A brief extract from Americas Policy Group of CCIC (KAIROS, Rights and Democracy and PWRDF) </strong></li>
        
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In August, Prime Minister Stephen Harper hosted his U.S. and Mexican counterparts in Montebello, Quebec. What was popularly called the &quot;Three Amigos&quot; meeting was in fact the third annual gathering of the three heads of state who make up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to discuss the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP). As the name suggests, this largely secretive process seeks to deepen NAFTA's economic measures while increasing &quot;security&quot; in the three countries. </p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the lead up to this meeting, PWRDF staff worked with other members of the Americas Policy Group of CCIC to produce a briefing note on human rights issues in the Canada-Mexico relationship. Entitled &quot;Security and Prosperity for Whom? Keeping Human Rights and Democracy in Focus in Canada's Relationship with Mexico&quot;, the brief examines a range of concerns that APG members and their Mexican counterparts have monitored and responded to over the years. The brief also calls for meaningful and transparent consultation in all three countries about the SPP, the lack of which &quot;has been at the expense of democratic process and the protection and fulfillment of the human rights of the citizens of Canada, Mexico and the United States.&quot;</p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>The full text of the brief can be found at:</strong> <u><a href="http://www.ccic.ca/e/003/apg.shtml" style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);"><strong>http://www.ccic.ca/e/003/apg.shtml</strong></a></u></p>
        
<li><strong>Keep the people of Burma in your prayers</strong></li>
          <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF staff are continually in touch with partners on the ground in the Thai-Burma border area. Amnesty International and Canadian civil society groups are working on sending a letter to the Prime Minister to act. We ask that you keep the people of Burma in your prayers.</p>
        
<li><strong>United Nations Adopts Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples </strong></li>
            <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">After more than 20 years of negotiations, the United Nations has adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The September 13 vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the international human rights instrument.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Canada was one of the four countries to vote against the non-binding declaration, along with the United States, Australia and New Zealand. All are countries with large indigenous populations.</p>

        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">On 19 August 2007, Hurricane Dean hit the Caribbean and made landfall in the islands of Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Haiti, before reaching the coasts of Honduras, Belize and Mexico. Torrential rain and strong winds created large-scale devastation. Jamaica and Haiti were the worst hit countries. Local members of Action by Churches Together (ACT) International are responding to the emergencies in Haiti and Jamaica. An ACT rapid response fund of US $20,000 was immediately sent to provide urgent food and non-food items to the affected people. An ACT appeal with a target of US $448, 873 has been issued to rehabilitate shelters and livelihoods of the affected communities and work towards disaster preparedness. </p>

        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Mrs Marj Keen, Parish Representative, All Saints, Weyburn Saskatchewan</strong> - we were delighted to hear from our Diocesan Representative, Basil Pogue about Marj Keen's involvement with PWRDF for over 30 years. Marj believes strongly in her ministry on behalf of PWRDF and found many creative ways to promote the fund, including selling produce from her garden and donating the money raised. We understand that her replacement, Debbie Hubick is another live wire, although can this be rwarded. Good luck Debbie in the years ahead - and thank you Marj.</p>
