<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">March is a busy month for staff travel:  Mahjabeen and Elsa are currently in the Philippines, Zaida in Burundi and Mozambique, Naba in Sri Lanka, and Suzanne will  shortly be leaving to visit partners in El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF, together with the United Church of Canada, Romero House and the Jesuit Migrant and Refugee Service, recently organized a seminar at Regis College, University of Toronto on &quot;Why Refugees from Mexico?&quot; at which three experts from Mexico and a Canadian academic explored the root causes of the increased refugee claimant flow from Mexico.  You can read Suzanne's report - <em><strong>Rampant violence in Mexico sends refugees to Canada</strong></em>, February 10 on our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews[year]=2008&tx_ttnews[month]=02&tx_ttnews[day]=10&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=385&tx_ttnews[backPid]=50&cHash=7d434ee39b">website</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Naba Gurung is currently visiting seven project partners in Sri Lanka that are implementing tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction projects.  Two-thirds of the coastal areas of the country were affected by the tsunami disaster.  In addition, Naba also intends to visit development projects in the southern part of the island.  Many of these areas are districts that have been the hotbed of ethnic violence, and sporadic violence has now spread in other parts of the island.  The projects he will be visiting include home gardening and biodiversity promotion, microfinance and income generation, people's  empowerment and leadership development, a permanent housing project with double displaced population (by violence and tsunami), and non-violent peace committees for tsunami rehabilitation. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Kumi Samuel, former board member of PWRDF, was recently in Toronto en route to Calgary and spoke to Church House staff over lunch about her work as director of the Women and Media Collective in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and their work in peace-building and peace-making.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">2. Canadian Council of Churches - G8 Tour</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Canadian Council of Churches, in collaboration with the G8 Research Group based at the Munk Centre for International Studies in the University of Toronto, has recently launched a five city cross-country tour of educational, inspirational public events.  Professor John Kirton opened the tour on February 25 at Convocation Hall, University of Winnipeg.  Future dates are:  <strong>March 30</strong> - St. Matthews United Church, Halifax,  <strong>April 13</strong>, Vancouver School of Theology,  and then Toronto and Montreal in the fall of 2008.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">CCC encourages everyone to join the journey to 2010 when Canada will host the G8 and also the parallel religious leaders' interfaith summit which will be speaking out on behalf of peace and justice for all God's children.<br>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Who are our local heroes?  You - our local volunteers, parish representatives, treasurers, diocesan representatives, coordinators, clergy, bishops  - who work so tirelessly to promote the work of PWRDF across Canada.  Thank you for all that you do.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In terms of Church House local heroes, the Finance team has completed the mailings of all tax receipts for 2007.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Christmas card sales generated over $38,000 in income for 2007, making a net profit for PWRDF programs of $23,000.  PWRDF appreciates the support of all who purchased the cards and, since 2007 was a memorable year for selling out so quickly, we shall ensure that we print additional quantities in 2008 in order to accommodate more requests. </p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">5.	PWRDF Regional Meetings</h3>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) is taking on a media campaign on a specific rule that relates to Family Reunification:  'excluded family members' rule that also touches on sponsored refugees:</p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>As part of our ongoing efforts to overcome the problems associated with Regulation 117(9)(d) (excluded family members), the CCR is preparing to do a public media campaign, highlighting the devastating impact of this rule on families.  We are looking for affected people who are willing to have their story told in the media.  The cases must of course be sympathetic.  Ideally, we want people who are willing to speak to 
journalists, but it will also be useful to have some cases that we write up in the background materials, even if the individuals are not ready to be interviewed.  Where necessary we can use only first names, or a pseudonym, if that is a concern.  Media attention on a case could potentially help to get the case resolved, although there is of course no guarantee of that.</em></p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">If you know of appropriate cases, please contact <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:jdench@ccrweb.ca">jdench@ccrweb.ca</a>.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">If you need more information to understand Regulation 117(9)(d), consult          &quot;Families Never to be United: Excluded Family Members&quot;, April 2005, at
