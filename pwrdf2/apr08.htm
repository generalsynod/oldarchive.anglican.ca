<p style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"><strong>Liturgy for Maundy Thursday</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em><strong>This is the day that Christ, the Lamb of God, gave himself into the hands of those who would slay him.<br>
  This is the day that Christ gathered with his disciples in the upper room.<br>
  This is the day that Christ took a towel and washed the disciples feet, giving us an example that we should do to others as he has done to us.<br>
  This is the day that Christ our Lord gave us this holy feast, that we who eat this bread and drink this cup may here proclaim his Holy Sacrifice and be partakers of his resurrection.</strong></em></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">1. <em>just</em>generation.ca New Resources</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Many of you have already received our new youth resource, <em>Off-the-Grid</em>.  We have been delighted with the response to this, and if you have not yet placed your order, please contact. <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:youth@pwrdf.org">youth@pwrdf.org</a></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In addition, PWRDF is producing a poster to advertise your Off-the-Grid event - it's a double-sided poster - one side promotes ideas on how to get involved in global justice, and the other side is the poster to include location and contact information.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Please watch out for the new <strong>Youth Handbook</strong> that should be out in May.  Jenny Salisbury, a youth worker at St. Clement's Anglican Church in Toronto, has been volunteering her time and creativity to this project.  Thanks to Jenny for her work on this - its been wonderful to have her around the office.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">2. Goodbye from Rob Crosby-Shearer</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">It's been just over one-and-a-half years since I was hired as Youth Initiative staff person at PWRDF, and it's been a great ride; getting to learn about and to be a little part of all the amazing work that you do for PWRDF in Canada - and getting to share the work that partners do in the struggle for just and sustainable development in Canada and around the world.  I'll be leaving this job at the end of March with much joy in my heart and gratitude for what the Spirit has accomplished here, and for how I've grown and been challenged as a part of this work.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the last year-and-a-half, we've done a lot.  We developed &quot;<em>just</em>generation.ca&quot; (both the name-branding and the website - including lots of promotional material), developed <em>Off-The-Grid</em> as a great eco-justice resource (thanks Eric!), developed an intern program, got the Youth Council positions mostly filled up and expanded (adding the Roman Catholics through <em>Development and Peace</em> and the Lutherans through our <em>ELCIC</em> youth partner member) as well as got their connection to the wider organization more integrated, produced a bunch of other resources (including the <em>Questioning Development</em> DVD and a bunch of print articles), participated in national Justice Camp, a trip to the School of the Americas, and in planning the upcoming Generation 2008.  We launched the <em>Looking Glass</em> podcasts. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">We compiled a list of 300 active Anglican Youth groups in Canada and a large email list. To help those youth groups, we've established <em>just</em>fund - $15,000 annually to get groups active in justice work (apply for funds with your own creative proposal)! I've had the honour of participating (with two youth council members) in the Mexico delegation a year ago, and witnessing the work of PWRDF partners there was life-changing!</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">We've also just finished re-writing the outdated Youth Handbook, thanks to the amazing work of Jenny Salisbury, who is a youth worker at St. Clement's Anglican and a volunteer in the office.  It should be ready in the next month or so to ship out!</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">And the future is looking up! As we speak, there are a good number of youth groups planning <em>Off-The-Grid</em> or similar events this spring and summer (don't forget to register with us and get your two free Fair Trade shirts!).  We've been in conversation with various global partners about how to connect youth in their contexts with Anglican Youth in Canada and the youth council is working on that, including the Anglican Church of Burundi. We also hope to get more involved in the Canadian Foodgrains Bank Youth Food Study Tour next year.  We're also hoping to formally launch youth Diocesan Reps as part of the 50th anniversary of PWRDF. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The <em>just</em>generation.ca staff position is being expanded to 4/5ths time which hopefully means that the person will have more time to get 'on the ground' connecting with Anglicans in the dioceses and parishes so that we can all support each other in this amazing work. Watch out for <em>just</em>generation.ca coming to your part of the country sometime soon! </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">It is my hope that <em>just</em>generation.ca can, empowered by the Holy Spirit, grow into a springboard for a national movement of Anglican youth who are living their baptismal covenants in creative and passionate ways in the struggle for global justice and to challenge us all to get in right relation with all of God's creation! </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">I'll still be around. I'm going to stay on the PWRDF Speakers Bureau, and am currently in discussions about being part of something creative and 'missional' in the Diocese of Toronto.  I'll also continue to be part of my home parish, Church of the Redeemer.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">So, a massive thanks to all of you out there, especially the amazing Youth Council, interns Eric Traficante and Heather Pearson, podcast producer Christan Harvey and volunteers (too many to list - but Jenny Salisbury especially) who've made <em>just</em>generation.ca what it is!  Also, a big thanks to my co-workers at the office; such an amazing team! </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the struggle for justice - and, as we celebrate Easter, let all, as Wendell Berry says - &quot;practice resurrection&quot;!  In Christ... another world is possible!!! <br>
Rob Crosby-Shearer<br>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The next issue of Under the Sun will be mailed next week - the theme being micro-finance.  <em>Did you know</em>  ... almost one billion people, one-sixth of humanity, subsist on less than a dollar a day and are largely invisible in the markets.  And yet they can be recipients of market benefits through socially responsible investing in microcredit RRSPs.  Typically, each $1,000 invested for a year creates five jobs for people in poor villages around the world.  For more information on how you can make a difference, check out <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.oikocredit.org/sa/fca/doc.phtml">Oikocredit</a> website.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">If you would like additional copies in bulk of Under the Sun to distribute to every member of your parish, please email <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:pwrdf@pwrdf.org">pwrdf@pwrdf.org</a> with the number required and name and address where to send.  We shall be happy to include the additional quantities in our distribution list.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">March 21 marks this day - and even though it coincides with Easter celebrations this year, we can keep it in our work and hearts.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>&quot;Racist practices hurt their victims, but they also limit the promise of entire societies where they are tolerated. They prevent individuals from realizing their potential and stop them from contributing fully to national progress.&quot;</em> - Ban Ki-moon United Nations Secretary-General. </p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">5.	Canadian Foodgrains Bank</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As you are aware, PWRDF became a member of CFGB last year and, as such, increased its involvement and that of our partners in food aid and food justice.   To find out more about CFGB, read the article from our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=378">website</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Donations may be made directly through PWRDF at <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.pwrdf.org/give/canadahelps/">https://www.pwrdf.org/give/canadahelps/</a> and clicking on the CanadaHelps logo.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>About donations:</strong>  By donating directly online through CanadaHelps, you are entering a secure website and your receipt is provided immediately by CanadaHelps.   You may also chose to donate through your parish.  The allocation designations on CanadaHelps are changed periodically.  Undesignated funds give us the freedom to allocate funds according to the long-term plans and priorities we have negotiated with our partners.  We believe this gives donors effective programs we can stand behind and evaluate on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the case of emergency appeals, PWRDF often sends an initial grant and then issues an appeal requesting designated donations.  Designated giving can strengthen the over-all program when it reflects an additional contribution, over and above a donation to support the core program.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">6.	<em></em>Millennium Development Goals</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Saskatchewan Council for International Cooperation (SCIC) has recently published  # 2 in its comic series - Learning and Building Together which relates to MDG #2:  Achieve Universal Primary Education.  You may obtain copies by emailing: <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:scic@web.ca">scic@web.ca</a> or phoning 306-757-4669.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">7.	Our work is your story</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Mahjabeen Chowdhury has recently returned from the Philippines, Cordillera region and will be providing an update on our partners work in that area.  Cordillera region is predominantly inhabited by indigenous people who struggle to maintain their livelihoods by growing vegetables on small terrace plots on the slope of the mountains.  Recently, there has been a growing threat to their livelihoods as the government is encouraging foreign investors to purchase lands on the mountain slopes to grow vegetables on a larger commercial scale.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Another area of concern is the mining community of Mancayan - its operation for gold and copper causes environmental destruction, pollution of local river systems, marine life, and exploits labour .  The community has very poor infrastructure.  PWRDF Partner Cordillera Peoples Alliance is advocating for sustainable small scale mining in the area.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>On the Road - Side by Side</strong> - this little booklet, originally produced in 1999 has recently been reproduced - it interprets the work of PWRDF as an &quot;Emmaus Road&quot; walk in partnership.  It includes a basic description of the PWRDF program and ways of working.  For copies, please email <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:pwrdf@pwrdf.org">pwrdf@pwrdf.org</a></p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.625em;"><em>Through the liturgy we recall the last supper, the agony in the garden and the trial.  On Good Friday we are following Jesus hour by hour, and moment by moment.  As he hangs on the cross we cling to his words, forgiving all who look to him in faith, caring for his dear mother, thirsting for refreshment, longing for love's redeeming work to be finished, commending his spirit into the hands of his Father.  As he breathes his last there is silence - in our hearts and throughout the whole Church.  Our Lord, as the Apostles<em>'</em> Creed puts it, is &quot;dead and buried.&quot;</em></p>
