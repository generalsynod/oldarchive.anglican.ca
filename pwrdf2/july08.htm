<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Burma &amp; China - </strong>Anglicans responded overwhelmingly to the recent emergencies in Burma and China with funds received up to the end of June totaling $353,000. We are still receiving funds, even though the deadlines for CIDA to match donations has passed.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Philippines </strong>- ACT International responded through the Rapid Response Fund to support immediate needs after typhoon Fengshen battered the Philippines for two days leaving at least 229 people dead and many more who lost their lives after a passenger ferry capsized</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">2.<em><strong> just</strong></em><strong>generation.ca</strong></h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Simon Chambers has been busy attending Generation 2008 and getting up to speed with the youth network since commencing at the end of May. Read Simon's account of the weeklong <strong><a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.justgeneration.ca/node/127">Generation 2008</a></strong> event and also an update of the group's who have participated to date in the <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.justgeneration.ca/node/134">Off the Grid youth event</a>.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">3. <em></em><strong></strong>Staff appointment</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Carolyn Vanderlip will join the staff team as 50th Anniversary Program Facilitator in July 2008 for a two year term. Carolyn will be responsible for the facilitation of the 50th Anniversary program from its launch in October 2008 to its conclusion in June 2010 which includes the facilitation of the sponsorship by dioceses of 50 refugee cases.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">4. Refugees - global refugee numbers on the increase</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">A new global survey says there were 11.4 million refugees outside their countries and 26 million others displaced internally by conflict or persecution at the end of 2007, contributing to an unprecedented number of uprooted people under the care of the UN refugee agency.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;After a five-year decline in the number of refugees between 2001 and 2005, we have now seen two years of increases, and that's a concern,&quot; UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ant&oacute;nio Guterres said in London as he kicked off a week of activities to mark World Refugee Day on June 20. &quot;We are now faced with a complex mix of global challenges that could threaten even more forced displacement in the future. They range from multiple new conflict-related emergencies in world hotspots to bad governance, climate-induced environmental degradation that increases competition for scarce resources, and extreme price hikes that have hit the poor the hardest and are generating instability in many places.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The report also lists other categories of concern to UNHCR, including stateless people, asylum seekers, returned refugees, returned internally displaced, and 'others.' In all, it lists 31.7 million people entitled to UNHCR support, excluding 4.6 million Palestinian refugees helped by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Are you looking for some summer activities to do with your children? If so, please check out our Families for PWRDF website that has activities for different age children. The specific focus relates to the <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf.org/give/families-for-pwrdf/">Family Calendar</a> that was produced for 2008.</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The <strong>June focus</strong> for the <strong><em>PWRDF Family Calendar</em></strong> was HIV and AIDS. Our partners have expressed concern about the interpretation of this situation. Despair is a luxury they dare not afford - and they challenge us to do the same. When you discuss the global AIDS pandemic with your family, be sure to emphasize that the church can play an important role in keeping hope alive in the fight against AIDS, when we speak openly about the virus and sexual health, educate ourselves about prevention, resist discrimination and care for bereaved families and orphaned children. <br>

  <br>
  Ecology is the July Focus of the PWRDF Family Calendar. As Christians we have a lot to offer the question of how to take better care of the world based on what we know about God who created it all and charged us to care for it all as stewards.<br>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In our May Email Update we asked for prayers for Bishop Pie Ntukamazina, Anglican Church of Burundi, Diocese of Bujumbura. In his latest communication, Bishop Pie said &quot;We, as a church, are expressing our thanks and appreciation for your support in prayers and writing to us with those encouraging words to sustain our faith. Please, continue to pray that concrete peace be established and good integration to this rebel group be better taken care of.&quot;</p>

The Breaking the Silence group is offering this training because of the urgent need for human rights accompaniers in Guatamala now and in the upcoming year, due to renewed human rights concerns (including in the mining sector) and some movement in the genocide cases.

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As part of Oikocredit's campaign to promote fair financing for development, they invite churches around the world to organize an Oikocredit Sunday focusing on fair trade.
