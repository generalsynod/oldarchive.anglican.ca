    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>From bake sales to concerts, turkey dinners to gold medal hockey parties&hellip;the response by Canadian Anglicans for Haiti Earthquake Relief has been exemplary.&nbsp; </strong>As of March 4, 2010 PWRDF has raised $2,052,624.86. Of this total, $1,990,141.21 is eligible for the government matching grant.&nbsp; For a taste of the responses we have heard about - check out this article on our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews%5byear%5d=2010&tx_ttnews%5bmonth%5d=02&tx_ttnews%5bday%5d=26&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=718&tx_ttnews%5bbackPid%5d=1&cHash=a3737070c5">website</a>.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As PWRDF staff wade through the thousands and thousands of cheques &ndash; preparing thank you letters and tax receipts &ndash; we are also dealing with the pressing question of what happens next for Haiti.&nbsp; PWRDF will be active in the rebuilding of the country.&nbsp; Through ACT (Action by Churches Together) International we are contributing to conversations seeking long-term solutions for Haiti.&nbsp; PWRDF staff is in direct communication with its partners on the ground and together with them will discern the next steps for long-term recovery work.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the meantime the following funds have been distributed:</p>
    <ul style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.625em;">

      Refugee Sponsorship Update</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In February 2009,&nbsp;the first of 50 refugee families who will be sponsored through PWRDF's 50 Refugee Families sponsorship initiative arrived in Edmonton. One year later, 30 sponsorships have been committed to and 19 of these families have already arrived in Canada. The most recent arrival was on February 11, 2010, when a family of 6 from the Democratic Republic of Congo arrived in Clarksburg Ontario, sponsored by St George's Anglican Church. A member of the sponsoring group says, &quot;Any expectations that we had have been surpassed by a gift of an amazing family. The wide eyed wonder of all of what the&nbsp;refugee family&nbsp;experienced today, put in perspective all of the long hours and hard work that so many have given tirelessly. The&nbsp;family could not express their delight and thankfulness for everything they received today. They have been blessed, but we have received a gift that none of us could replicate even if we tried.&quot; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">If your parish is interested in sponsoring a refugee family, please contact your diocesan refugee coordinator or Carolyn Vanderlip at PWRDF (416-924-9199 ext. 266 or <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:cvanderlip@pwrdf.org">cvanderlip@pwrdf.org</a>) for more information.    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong><em>Carbon Fast for Lent</em></strong><br>
    The issue of global climate change was front and centre in national media, on the web and in conversations across Canada and around the world last December as the COP15 UN Climate Change Conference happened in Copenhagen, Denmark. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The results of that conference left many feeling unsatisfied and wondering what they can do to begin to make a difference in their own lives to mitigate the effects of climate change. One way to begin to look at how you as an individual, and how we as Canadians, can make positive changes in our own carbon usage is to use the following Lenten resource, the <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://kairoscanada.org/index.php?id=71&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=916" title="http://kairoscanada.org">Carbon Fast for Lent</a>. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">KAIROS, Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives, developed this resource for use across Canada this Lent. The Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund, as a KAIROS partner agency, is pleased to recommend it for your use either this Lent or, if your parish or group already has a Lenten program in place, as an educational focus for your use at another time.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Calling for the release of 43 medical and health workers in the Philippines </em><br>
      The 43 medical and health workers were participating in a first responders training sponsored by the Community Medicine Foundation and the Council for Health and Development, when they were arrested on February 6th, 2010 by 300 soldiers in Morong, Rizal province.<br>
  <br>
      KAIROS joins the voices of partners in the Philippines, families and friends of the detained 43 medical and health workers and local, national and international human rights organizations in calling on the Government of the Philippines to:</p>
    <ul style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.625em;">
      <li>Immediately and unconditionally release the 43 detained medical and health workers;</li>
      <li>Ensure the safety of these detainees, provide unlimited access to their family members and legal counsel while in custody of the military; and</li>
      <li>Conduct an impartial investigation into the legality of their arrest and detention, and the allegations of torture and indignities inflicted on them while in detention. </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Furthermore, we join with other KAIROS members in calling on the Philippine President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as Chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to protect citizens from persecution, intimidation and violence directed against opposition groups and ensure that the coming national election in May is not marred by violence and fraud.<br>
      <br>
      We join the international community in calling on the Government of the Philippines to implement the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Philip Alston, which seek to bring an end to human rights violations in the country.<br>
  <br>
      We urge you to write letters to the Philippine President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to join our call for the immediate release of the detainees and to ensure their safety while in the custody of the military.

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Interfaith Leaders and the G8 &ndash; A Call for Action</em></p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">You are invited&hellip; with other Anglicans, other Christians and other people of faith to host a dinner in your community and to invite your Member of Parliament.&nbsp; You can do this any time between now and June 20, 2010.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">And when you gather to break bread, you are invited to talk with your interfaith neighbours and your MP about what unites you as people of faith and what message you want to send together to the Prime Minister in anticipation of the G8 and G20 summits.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The G8 and G20 summits meet this year in Canada, from June 25-27, 2010 in Huntsville and Toronto, Ontario.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the week leading up to the G8/G20 summits, from June 21-23, 2010, faith leaders from the Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Baha&rsquo;i, Aboriginal and other religious traditions will meet at the University of Winnipeg, with leadership from Archbishop Fred Hiltz, Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; Together they will discuss ways to communicate with world leaders and press them for action on the 2010 Interfaith Statement, <em>A Time for Inspired Leadership and Action</em>, released in October 2009<em>.&nbsp; </em><br>
      The statement requests world leaders to:<br>
      1.&nbsp; Address poverty;<br>
      2.&nbsp; Care for our earth;<br>
      3.&nbsp; Invest in peace.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Your involvement in hosting or participating in an interfaith dinner, meal or reception in your community, and the message you send to your Member of Parliament, will be a public act of commitment to the Millennium Development Goals and to the values we deeply hold as Anglicans and Christians.&nbsp; It will show your support for the Primate in his leadership role and will help to pave the way toward stronger interfaith collaboration in the future.&nbsp; If you and others in your community decide to host a dinner, there is a resource kit with guidelines and everything you need to know on-line at <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.faithchallengeg8.com">www.faithchallengeg8.com</a>. </p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Five years after the tsunami hit the beaches of the Indian Ocean and killed more than 227,000 people, ACT International has released a book about the catastrophe.&nbsp; With Courage, In Hope: Five Years After the Tsunami, written by freelance journalist and ACT communicator Chris Herlinger, describes the catastrophe through the eyes of those who survived and helped others survive and also by ACT staff members who responded to the disaster.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">&ldquo;The tsunami response was the greatest challenge the alliance had ever faced,&rdquo; said ACT International director John Nduna. &ldquo;Within weeks, close to 70 members of ACT were involved in planning the response, providing relief resources, running logistics and implementing the programmes. The people involved included ACT staff and volunteers and members of the communities themselves.&rdquo;</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The 200-page book, published by Geneva-based ACT International, critically analyzes the alliance&rsquo;s programmes and response. The tsunami created huge operational concerns, ethical dilemmas and political challenges for the ACT alliance.&nbsp; The book &ldquo;not only illustrates ways ACT succeeded but also lessons it was forced to learn,&rdquo; said Nduna. &ldquo;Conversely, it portrays the way life for tens of thousands of people was transformed for the better as a result of ACT programmes.&rdquo;</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The text is based on the reporting of ACT member communicators and staff. Herlinger, a New York-based writer and editor with ACT member Church World Service, was careful in his remarks at the 16 December book launch, held at the Ecumenical Center in Geneva, to point out that With Courage, In Hope is a book about collaboration &ndash; and not only about collaboration between relief workers and survivors.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>100 Mile Diet Challenge</em><br>
    Folks at Holy Trinity Parish in Cochrane were inspired by the book <em>100 Mile Diet: A Year of Eating Local.</em>&nbsp; In this book, a couple takes the challenge of only eating foods that are grown and produced within a hundred mile span of their Vancouver home.&nbsp; Their goal was to live &ldquo;lighter&rdquo; on this planet by reducing green house gas emissions involved in transporting food to our kitchen tables.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Inspired by this book, Holy Trinity Parish challenged folks in their community to think about their meals with a 100-mile mindset.&nbsp; They issued a &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo; &ndash; for folks to come up with a menu (breakfast, lunch or dinner) using, to the largest extent possible, only ingredients that were produced within 100 miles (160 kilometers) of Cochrane within any given 12 month period (frozen and preserved items are allowed in the 100 Mile Diet).</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Competitors needed to provide a copy of the menu, one of the dishes on the menu and copies of the recipes.&nbsp; Judging was based on the complete menu &ndash; the ingredients used and their 100-mile availability, the healthy balance of dishes and a taste test of one of the dishes prepared by the competitor.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">What a great opportunity to gather a community together, eat good food and raise awareness about the environment and ecological sustainability!&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Matching Donations</em><br>
      Many PWRDF donors were excited about the opportunity to have their donations for the Haiti earthquake matched by CIDA and went out of their way to see that funds were raised and donated. Other donors took advantage of their employers matching program, so that their $1,000 donation became $4,000 to facilitate change in Haiti. Ask your employer if they will match your donation to PWRDF, your charitable agency of choice! If your employer offers this option you can use it any time, not only for relief efforts.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As Public Engagement team leader I worshipped and worked with PWRDF volunteers and supporters in parishes large and small on Sunday mornings and just about any other time too. I have shared plane journeys with partners, colleagues and volunteers within in Canada and beyond. I have learned that Anglicans in Canada care about the world and strongly believe that they have a role to play in bringing about God&rsquo;s creation on earth. They recognize that we are all connected by being children of God and that we can Pray, Give and Act to change lives, change communities and change the world. I will miss being a part of this incredible circle of people as a staff person and pray that are our journeys will find ways to intersect again. &ndash; Beth Baskin</p>
