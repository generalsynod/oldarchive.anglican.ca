<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">4. PWRDF Humanitarian Response</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Food Crisis in Ethiopia </strong><br>
  Action by Churches Together Ethiopia Forum is actively engaged in emergency relief, recovery and rehabilitation programs in 15 districts of Ethiopia through an ACT Appeal that aims to reduce loss of life, minimize human suffering and ensure early recovery of the drought-affected population. The appeal targets to address the food needs of 120,880 people affected by the drought/food crisis, improve the nutritional status of the vulnerable groups and meet the early recovery needs of the drought affected population through the provision of agricultural inputs, mainly seeds.&nbsp; PWRDF contribution is $35,000 to this ACT appeal. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Democratic Republic of Congo </strong><br>
  ACT members in the DRC are targeting to assist 11,750 Internally Displaced Peoples (IDPs), returnees and host family households, approximately 58,750 people, in North and South Kivu. &nbsp;The activities under the appeal include provision of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities; distribution of agricultural inputs (seeds and tools); provision of nutritional supplements;&nbsp; psycho-social support and trauma healing; and distribution various relief items for immediate material needs. PWRDF contributed $25,000 to this appeal. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Response to Food Crisis in Afghanistan<br>
</strong>Huge displacement of farmers and the widespread destruction and lack of maintenance of rural infrastructure over more than two decades of war has created food crisis in the province of Zabul, Afghanistan. PWRDF and other members of the Canadian Foodgrains Bank have responded to this crisis in partnership with the Presbyterian World Service and Development who are taking a lead role for the project. The project aims at alleviating immediate food shortages through food-for-work projects, rehabilitating and developing basic infrastructure to tackle long-term food crisis, and improving livelihoods of community members through improvement in farming techniques. PWRDF contribution to this project is $20,000.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">5. Canadians Respond to hunger in Zimbawbe</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) members have responded to the growing need for food in Zimbawbe and provided rations to sustain approximately 120,000 beneficiaries for 5 months, until the next harvest.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">It is estimated that Zimbabwe faces one of the most significant food crises in the world in coming months, due to recent drought, poor agricultural policies, a lack of agricultural inputs, and a rapidly declining economy.&nbsp; Further compounding the situation is the high prevalence of HIV and AIDS and a recent cholera outbreak.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">However, there is some positive news as the CFGB supports long-term food security projects in three districts of Zimbawbe.&nbsp; Farmers with small land holdings are learning the principles of a new farming system called Conservation Farming.&nbsp; As a result, some farmers have tripled their corn yields through timely planting, precision fertilizer and manure placement and covering the soil with mulch to reduce soil erosion and conserve moisture.&nbsp; In particular, moisture conservation has been key, given the increasing intensity and frequency of droughts in the region.&nbsp; The mulch layer for many farmers is the difference between no yield and food for 3 to 6 months to feed their families.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">6. PWRDF 2009 Family Calendar</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Our calendar for 2009 is a gift to you and your congregations.&nbsp; As we are celebrating our 50th anniversary, we wanted to share with you many of the successes that we have.&nbsp; Each month the calendar highlights a partner in one of the regions where we work and at the back there is a corresponding page or two of activities.&nbsp; We think you will find it appropriate for all age groups, as well as being informative and educational.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">One of the most important principles of our work has always been partnership.&nbsp; Our 50th anniversary logo is a symbol of hands around the world joined in partnership and solidarity; hands extended and linked in the belief that together, we can changes lives, change communities, and change the world.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Bishop Kumara Illangasinghe from Kurunegla, Sri Lanka sent the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">&ldquo;<em>Greetings from Kurunegla, Sri Lanka!&nbsp; We are in receipt of the calendar and Christmas blessings sent by PWRDF, which arrived in our office today.&nbsp; The theme verse included is a great message of hope and perseverance in a time of difficulty.&nbsp; Especially in Sri Lanka, where we long for &ldquo;living water&rdquo; in the midst of conflict, we are assured to hear that the tree will not die, and will sprout young, healthy shoots</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The 2009 justice camp will be held August 9-15 in the Diocese of Nova Scotia and PEI in Halifax and the theme will focus in on poverty &ndash; &ldquo;Finding Abundance&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Justice camps are week-long immersion experiences focusing on a specific justice issue in the light of Bible study and prayer.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re an initiative of the Partners in Mission and Ecojustice Committee at General Synod, but are locally lead.&nbsp; Each camp integrates hands-on experience, and includes a mix of ages, of men and women, of locals and out-of-towners with 50% of the age range being 18-30 and 50% over 30.&nbsp; PWRDF is involved on the planning team and will be offering financial support to attendees from PWRDF networks, watch for more news next month.

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The 2008 PWRDF Appeal is currently being mailed to all direct donors. We have included a PWRDF bookmark as well as a wallet card &quot;<em>123s of MDGs&quot; </em>where we outlined the 8 Millennium Development Goals in an easy to read format. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">We understand how difficult these economic times may be for some donors, but we also believe that as Anglicans we respond in hope. As noted by the Primate in his letter</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;I ask you to join me on this journey of transformation and to assist PWRDF in reaching the 2008 appeal goal of $100,000.&nbsp; I believe that responding in hope carries out our gospel call to &quot;love one another as I have loved you.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">We believe it is important to communicate the work of partners and the work that donors support through their donations. Please let us know what you are interested in hearing about. We are also interested in sharing some donor stories about why donors believe in and financially support PWRDF.&nbsp; If you know of any stories, or names for us to contact in order to hear their story, please let us know.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As we begin to think ahead to the New Year, Annual Vestry meetings can&rsquo;t be far away. These important meetings occur in late January or February depending on your parish. Consider a conversation with your clergy person or wardens to see what the plans are for the meeting. Can you do a short PWRDF presentation? Could the lunch use PWRDF placements and bookmarks? Will you or someone else be continuing in the role of PWRDF parish representative? If not, have the nominating committee included the role of PWRDF parish representative on their list of positions to fill.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Vestry meetings are key moments in the life of our parishes when we can celebrate the ministries we have been involved in and look ahead to the new ones we can undertake. Make sure that PWRDF is part of the conversation. For more information and ideas be sure to get a copy of &quot;The Vital Link&quot; a tool kit for parish representatives <a href="mailto:pwrdf@pwrdf.org">pwrdf@pwrdf.org</a>.</p>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">10.	10.	Local Heroes &ndash; <em>&hellip;and a little child shall lead them &hellip;</em> (Isaiah 11: 1-10).</h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">This was submitted by Judy Oatway, PWRDF Board member who attended our regional meeting in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia in early October, 2008:</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">It was on Sunday, October 5, as a most successful weekend spent in fellowship and dialogue with our indigenous partners of Membertu&hellip;in the parish of St. Mary&rsquo;s, Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, was gradually coming to an end.&nbsp; It is tradition at the close of such Regional Meetings that PWRDF staff and board members visit nearby parishes to share the stories of the work of&nbsp; PWRDF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beth Baskin left with the Rev. Vernon Reid to visit two of his five point parish ministry.&nbsp; I remained in Glace Bay to be the guest of the Rev. Fev Arnold, Priest Assistant, and the congregation of St. Mary&rsquo;s and had the privilege to share the PWRDF story that morning.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The narthex gradually filled with relatives and friends&hellip; exchanging greetings, asking after each other&rsquo;s health, commenting on the national election&hellip;when I was approached by a woman, eager to share her story.&nbsp; It was on January 5, 2005, less than two weeks after the devastating tsunami that created death and destruction throughout much of Indonesia, that Rebecca Mailman, her granddaughter, celebrated her eleventh birthday.&nbsp; The word had been sent out by Rebecca to her friends that they were not to bring gifts but donations that would be sent to the relief of those whose lives had been altered forever.&nbsp; Rebecca and her grandmother sent the birthday funds to PWRDF where they were matched by the Canadian government.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Rebecca is a regular supporter of PWRDF.&nbsp; She fills the coin boxes and encourages her friends to do the same.&nbsp; Rebecca will soon be 15.&nbsp; She is still an active parishioner of St. Mary&rsquo;s and a member of the Junior Choir.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Rebecca is the daughter of Donna and Darryl Mailman.</p>
<h3>Wishing you peace, love and happiness in this blessed season</h3>
