<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"><strong>1. Partner Safety</strong></h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As is often the case in Latin America, PWRDF is currently very concerned about the safety of its partner, Miriam Iquique, who is the coordinator of the Ecumenical Women's Network (REM) in Guatemala. Miriam has recently had her son kidnapped, some cousins assassinated, and Miriam herself has suffered two assaults and in the past, telephoned death threats. As Suzanne Rumsey, LA/C Program Coordinator, notes, &quot;it is difficult to determine whether or not Miriam is being targeted for her organizing work among rural, Mayan Indigenous women, that is, whether these attacks are politically motivated. Nevertheless, those of us in PWRDF who have met and worked with Miriam are gravely concerned for her safety.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">We ask for your prayers of solidarity for Miriam, her husband and nine children and for all those in Guatemala who are victims of violence.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Please see update to this story on our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews[year]=2009&tx_ttnews[month]=05&tx_ttnews[day]=23&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=526&tx_ttnews[backPid]=1&cHash=ea1b50ffd3">website</a>.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">2. PWRDF Partner Receives International Recognition </h3>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF recently learned that one of our partners in El Salvador, ADES (Association for Social and Economic Development, Santa Marta), was one of a group of Salvadoran organizations to receive the prestigious Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Established by the U.S.-based Institute for Policy Studies, the award is named after the late Chilean diplomat, Orlando Letelier, and IPS staff member, Ronni Karpen Moffit, who were killed in 1976 in Washington D.C. by a car bomb planted by agents of Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet. Since 1978 the award has honoured individuals and organizations throughout the Americas for their work to defend and promote human rights.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In its letter to the National Coordination on Mining in El Salvador (of which ADES is a founding member), the IPS recognized &quot;the valour with which it undertook the struggle, in spite of all the challenges, to transform El Salvador into the first country to prohibit gold mining. This is a victory for rural communities and for the environment, helping to prevent the great devastation of open pit mines... the displacement of peasant communities and the enriching of corporations at the expense of the poor.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF joins other partners in congratulating ADES for its steadfast and persistent work of empowering local communities to defend and promote their human rights. ADES was the partner that made ceramic medallions for our 40th anniversary and are featured in the video &quot;Strength of Many Hands&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Naba Gurung, our Program Coordinator for Refugees and Emergencies has provided the following update about displacement in Pakistan:</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As Pakistan military and militants enter the third week of armed conflict, over 2.5 million people have been displaced by violence and the numbers are expected to rise. The United Nations Refugee Agency believes this may become the largest displacement of people since the Rwanda crisis and is calling for hundreds of millions of dollars in international aid for relief efforts.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Displaced people in Pakistan are facing a crisis in food, clean water and shelter. Many people have witnessed violence, and education and health services have been disrupted. A major concern is the medical assistance needed by those fleeing the fighting and forced to live in camps or with host families.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF is working with church denominations in Canada through the Canadian Foodgrains Bank to help thousands of displaced families. The local partner Church World Service - Pakistan/Afghanistan, a member of the Action by Churches Together International network, is responding to the needs of the most severely affected and working to ease this humanitarian crisis.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Simon Chambers says:</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">It's been a rare treat to be part of the planning process for Justice Camp this year. The camp is taking place in Halifax and environs from Aug 8-15, 2009 with the theme of &quot;Finding Abundance&quot;. The planning team has done a great job of approaching the concept of Poverty in a variety of creative ways!</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The camp will explore a broad range of issues through 3-day immersion experiences (each participant will choose one immersion). Immersions include:<br>
  Housing and Homelessness, Urban Poverty Information, Education and Public Policy, Economic Development and Education, Global Abundance, Survival ... Homes, Food and Work, Combating Cultural Poverty, and Disabled and Marginalized Groups.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">I'm really excited to be able to be part of the camp, which has embraced the goal of creating an intergenerational experience with 50% of participants being between 18-30 years old, and 50% older. The planning team has embraced this idea, which has led to a lively, fun-filled experience. If the camp involves half as much laughter and community, it will be a fantastic week!</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Poverty Justice Camp will provide a great chance for people to come together, share their passion for justice work, learn more about issues of poverty and abundance, and return home empowered to work as advocates and activists! The registration deadline is June 12. More details and registration information can be found at their website at <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.justicecamp.ca/">www.justicecamp.ca</a>.</p>

After our last e-newsletter we received a great response and all the stoles were purchased in that same week. Your support has not only provided Miriam and many others with a sustainable future, it has also ensured a safe and caring community of faith which crosses all boarders and boundaries. We are also very grateful to all our readers for your very supportive response to this e-newsletter. </p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">World Refugee Day (WRD) is fast approaching. The theme in 2009 focuses on refugee needs and is titled &quot; Real People, Real Needs.&quot; UNHCR has chosen this theme to highlight the human story of refugees and their needs and, to increase awareness and understanding about the importance of meeting those needs. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Despite the efforts of many, including UNHCR, the needs of refugees worldwide including shelter, health, education, food security, sanitation, the prevention of sexual violence and even legal status in countries of asylum, are far from being met. Behind these unmet needs are not just numbers but real people with real stories. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">To support this theme, UNHCR has produced a poster for distribution to those wishing to mark the event. UNHCR short movie Global View 2009 is also available. Your orders can be sent to <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:nyembwe@unhcr.org">nyembwe@unhcr.org</a>. The deadline for receiving orders is 5 June 2009.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">If you would like your event to be posted on the <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.unhcr.ca/wrd">WRD page</a>, please send a message to <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:nyembwe@unhcr.org">nyembwe@unhcr.org</a></p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Please note that this year, the annual resources <strong>will not be automatically</strong> distributed to all parishes as in the past.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As we streamline our processes and cut costs, we shall be advising all parishes of this in June and requesting that they confirm in writing whether they require and use the existing resources, or whether changes should be made to their order. Please make sure that your parish is made aware of this, and that they respond accordingly, otherwise, we cannot guarantee that resources will be available, particularly for last minute requests. Please watch out for this mailing in your parish and make sure that we receive a response, so that we can support your work.</p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"><strong>11. Family Calendar Focus 2009</strong></h3>

Do involve your children, grandchildren and Sunday School children in these activities -- and enjoy!</p>
