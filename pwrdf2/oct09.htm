<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong><em>KAIROS Urgent Action on Honduras</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">KAIROS is gravely concerned about the violence and human rights violations in Honduras in the aftermath of the coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat staged on June 28 and the recent escalation in violence and use of excessive force by the coup regime.&nbsp; On September 21, nearly 3 months after being forced from power and expelled from the country by a military- backed group of politicians, democratically elected President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales clandestinely returned to Honduras and is residing in the Brazilian Embassy. President Zelaya has called for negotiations with the de facto regime as a first step towards the peaceful resolution of the crisis.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Take Action</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In the face of the escalation in violence and repression in Honduras, Canada has failed to effectively isolate the coup regime.&nbsp; We need to speak out now and demand action from the Canadian government.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Please take a few minutes to phone or email the Canadian Minister of State, Peter Kent, urging Canada to apply targeted sanctions and ensure democratic order, respect for human rights and the rule of law.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The following urgent action provides a <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.maquilasolidarity.org/Honduras-Urgent-Action">sample script and letter</a> as well as contact information for Minister Kent.</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Friday, October 16th is World Food Day, which celebrates the day that Food and Agricultural Organization was founded in Quebec City in 1945. It is now observed annually in some 150 countries. Churches across the country will do their part by joining together in A DAY OF FASTING AND REFLECTING on how we are connected to issues of food injustice and hunger. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Foodgrains Bank provides the Fast for Change program so that Christians from all over Canada can be united by our belief that hunger in a world of such abundance is a matter of injustice.

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The comings and the goings of folks at the Primate&rsquo;s Fund &hellip; This past summer Patience Mbwizhu (Donor Relations Officer) and Yvonne Lane (Network Associate) left PWRDF.&nbsp; Although Yvonne has only semi-retired, as she frequents the office fulfilling a part-time contract.&nbsp; She will be able to enjoy her full retirement following the Diocesan Leadership Forum at the end of October.&nbsp; We also say goodbye and good luck to Aaron Emery our summer intern.&nbsp; We are thankful for the work Aaron was able to do over the summer months and look forward to his future participation with PWRDF as a member of Youth Council.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Joining the staff this fall are Graham McCaffrey (justgeneration.ca intern), Jennifer Brown (Donor Relations Officer) and Sheilagh McGlynn (Public Engagement Associate).</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Graham will be with us from September through December 21, 2009.&nbsp; Graham will work directly with Simon Chambers, the justgeneration.ca facilitator, and members of the PWRDF&rsquo;s Public Engagement Team to promote and support the involvement of young people (16-30) in the work of PWRDF. We hope that the time Graham spends with us at PWRDF will equip him with a broad view of the mission and ministry of PWRDF and the Anglican Church as he pursues his goal of parish ministry.<br>
  Jennifer brings a rich mix of experience to PWRDF having worked in both corporate, government and not-for-profit environments in a variety of positions of responsibility. Jennifer will facilitate the building of relationships with parishes, dioceses and parishioners. The position of Donor Relations Officer is key to the development and sustainability of those relationships and helps to further the work of the whole staff team. <br>
