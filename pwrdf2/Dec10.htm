    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">At its November meeting the Board of Directors adopted a new vision statement for PWRDF. Concise and memorable, it names what PWRDF longs for and works toward: a truly just, healthy and peaceful world. As staff we would like to embody that vision not only in our international partner relationships, but within PWRDF networks, and in the ways we work together at 80 Hayden Street. The Christmas incarnation is surely a startling invitation to be in the world, to know, care for and love it, and believe that together with the Holy One of Bethlehem, we can be part of making a truly just, healthy and peaceful world. We are deeply grateful for your companionship on the journey.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">To mark World AIDS Day on December 1, staff at Church House gathered in the chapel for a service of worship organized by PWRDF. Excerpts from the 2004 PWRDF World AIDS Day worship resource, Point of Light were used, and Zaida Bastos, CIDA Program Coordinator for PWRDF gave the homily, reflecting on the significant changes that have occurred in how the disease is being addressed by the international community, and treated at the local level. Following are her reflections. <a href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews[year]=2010&tx_ttnews[month]=12&tx_ttnews[day]=03&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=817&tx_ttnews[backPid]=1&cHash=ddee98f27ca945c9e25fa509df3a290c">Read Zaida's homily</a>.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The campaign to fix the flaws in Canada's Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR) continues. Read the <u><a href="https://www.aidslaw.ca/publications/publicationsdocEN.php?ref=1151">open letter to Members of Parliament</a></u> released on World AIDS Day by leading Canadian NGOs, calling for action to restore the key reform recently removed from Bill C-393 by a Parliamentary committee. The bill is expected to be up for debate in the House of Commons later this month.

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Terence Sibanda is a youth intern from Zimbabwe serving at Canadian Foodgrains Bank for a one-year term. He is trained in Conservation Agriculture, a method of small-scale farming that is increasing yields in drought-ridden areas using simple, easily accessible tools. He has been teaching this method to farmers in his region and helping them to become self-sufficient once again. </em><em><em>If you are interested in having Terence come and speak to your area, contact Dave Colvinson at: </em></em><em><a href="mailto:d_colvinson@foodgrainsbank.ca">d_colvinson@foodgrainsbank.ca</a> or at 1.800.665.0377.</em></p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Staying in &quot;friendly Manitoba&quot; has meant that I've met a lot of people who have been very friendly and engaging. I have had the opportunity to visit several communities throughout the province and I have been greatly encouraged by the way farmers, companies and supporters work together for a just cause. When in Niverville for a harvest, I witnessed 13 combines harvest a 90 acre field of canola in one hour, a process which could have lasted for days with a single harvester... <a href="https://www.foodgrainsbank.ca/news/1231/reflections_on_canadian_generosity.aspx">Read more of Terence's reflections</a>.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Jose Zarate visits partners in Cuba</strong></p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">I visited Cuba from November 20 to the 29, 2010 to meet with partner organizations' staff and learn about their program activities, as well as to learn about the context and recent developments in Cuba. I participated in a series of meetings with each of PWRDF's three partners: the Martin Luther King Centre - MLKC , the Christian Centre for Reflection and Dialogue – CCRD , and the Council of Churches of Cuba – CCC . I also met with representatives of the Episcopal Church of Cuba to explore future collaboration. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Cuba is a country blockaded economically and financially causing a noticeable scarcity of basic necessities for the life of the population. In terms of food security, Cuba has a high dependence on food imports due to, among other reasons, the predominance of monoculture agricultural production for export, and the application of conventional methods of production by the government agricultural sector. This includes a high dependence on external inputs such as fuel, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and machinery. This situation has been exacerbated by drastic climactic disasters that have hit the country in recent years, causing extensive damage to habitat, agriculture and livestock. It is in this context that food production constitutes a major priority for the country. Despite government policies that have reduced the impact of the crisis in the areas of health, education and social security, there is an official recognition of food shortages. Therefore, the government is encouraging the population to become involved in food production and conservation to maintain a good diet and health. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The common aim among PWRDF's Cuban partners is to promote programs and community projects directed to organic farming and to foster a gender approach in community work. These programs use agro-ecological techniques, and crop diversification with the goal of sustaining both household consumption and providing revenue through the sale of excess production.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Naba Gurung and Simon Chambers travel to India and Sri Lanka </strong></p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">From November 15 to December 3, 2010, I visited communities in South India and Sri Lanka with whom PWRDF partners are working. During the first 3 days, PWRDF Communications Coordinator Simon Chambers and I visited a number of villages in the coastal villages of South India where Churches' Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA), India, assisted families affected by the South Asian Tsunami with permanent houses and various livelihood and income generating initiatives. The formal project, funded by the Tsunami matching fund from CIDA, ended about 2 years ago, and we wanted to see how the families have been doing after the &quot;project&quot; was over. It was a joy to meet these people again, and to see the communities living happily in those houses and with most of the village level enterprises thriving. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">I visited PWRDF longstanding partner OfERR (Organization for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation) that works with over 77,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in more than 100 camps spread across the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. I was able to visit 4 camps in the rural districts and meet with refugees who are engaged in providing nutritional supplements to undernourished children, cultivating spirulina (a highly nutritious algae), doing kitchen gardening, cultivating mushrooms, establishing vegetable shops and food canteens etc. These are the project activities that PWRDF has funded with support from the Canadian Food Grains Bank (CFGB). As in my previous visits, the women's Self-Help Groups took the lead role in welcoming me in the camps and profiled various facets of their work. In all the camps, children and youth groups showed me their poster drawings, mainly on the issues of global warming and climate change and also made presentations using drama on these themes.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In Sri Lanka, I was with the Sri Lankan branch of OfERR that is working with the people who are returning to their original villages after being displaced during the internal conflict. I visited 3 villages in Mannar district and 3 villages in Batticaloa district, all of which used to be under the control of Liberation Tamil Tigers Eelam (LTTE) in the past. OfERR is engaged in helping the communities in their resettlement efforts, through provision of agricultural and animal husbandry training and inputs, water wells, mobility support (e.g. bicycles) and pre-school facilities for children. PWRDF has been co-funding these activities through funds from the Manitoba Council for International Cooperation. Women have started savings and other community activities through Self-Help Groups. Signs of war could be easily seen in the villages, mainly in the form of desolate buildings and the villagers reported a lack of basic infrastructure such as water, toilet, electricity, transportation, health posts, etc. PWRDF will continue to support projects through its own funds and also accessing grants from the Manitoba Council for International Cooperation (MCIC) and CFGB.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Anatomy of a Village Visit – Simon Chambers Blogs from India </strong></p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">I have visited several villages and projects over the last few days. In a lot of ways, visiting projects here in India echoes my experiences in Burundi, so I thought I'd write about what these visits look like. <br>
  <br>
      When we arrive at the village/project, we are generally greeted by a group of 10-30 people. Here in India, we have twice had women perform ceremonies involving fire, marking our foreheads with different colours and--once--aspersion with water. We are often handed gifts like lemons- signs of respect and welcome<br>
  <br>
      We are then led into the local community building and given seats in the ubiquitous plastic chairs that I've seen all over the developing world when I've traveled. The local people gather in the space and sit down--usually on the floor. Children usually in front. Then we are given gifts of welcome- here in India, it is generally either a wreath of flowers long enough to reach my waist or a cloth that is put over the shoulders. At one point I had two wreaths AND a cloth on, since we were greeted by several groups at the same time! After we have been greeted, often a song is sung or a dance is performed for us.<br>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>By Rachael Pollesel, PWRDF/justgeneration.ca Intern</em><br>
  &quot;On Friday, October 22nd, I had the opportunity to travel to London, Ontario for the Diocese of Huron's 3rd Annual <a href="https://www.justgeneration.ca/multimedia">U2charist</a> service which was raising funds for the 12 by 2012: Building Communities joint Anglican/Lutheran youth project . I must say, while I was excited to be able to promote the awesome work of the PWRDF and to see a few friends I've made through National Church events, I was, well...a little less than excited at the prospect of going to a U2charist.&quot; <a href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews[year]=2010&tx_ttnews[month]=11&tx_ttnews[day]=22&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=813&tx_ttnews[backPid]=1&cHash=af4ac27414d017bed8271df5dd904a86">Find out how Rachael became excited...</a></p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Art Babych is the editor of Crosstalk, the newspaper of the diocese of Ottawa. <br>
    OTTAWA -- Action on climate change is becoming so urgently needed that even scientists trained not to make value judgements see it as a moral  issue. What's more, we may be &quot;running out of time,&quot; says Dr. John Stone, adjunct research professor, geography and environmental studies, at Carleton University in Ottawa. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">&quot;Climate change has now become such a threat  to our society, economy and environment that some of us find it difficult, if not irresponsible, to remain within our [objective] disciplinary domains,&quot; he told a Nov. 14 workshop at The Church of St. John the Evangelist (Anglican) Church here. &quot;We have defined the problem, now we need to put all our efforts into developing and implementing solutions.&quot; </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Dr. Stone is also vice-chair of a working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The workshop is part of a series on environmental decline and climate change moderated by the Rev. Dr. Mishka Lysack, an Anglican priest and assistant professor of social work at the University of Calgary.   </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Bishop John Chapman of the Anglican diocese of Ottawa, spoke from a faith perspective to the over 50 people who attended the workshop,  entitled, Science and Faith: Climate Change as a Moral Issue. &quot;Through the cross, Christ redeemed the world, not just humanity, he said. &quot;All has been redeemed.&quot; </p>

  Church House restructuring shuts down Partnerships department</strong> </h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>Leigh Anne Williams</em><br>
    Restructuring at the Anglican Church of Canada head offices in Toronto has resulted in the closure of the Partnerships department as of November 1. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In addition, there will no longer be a full-time librarian on staff at General Synod library, beginning in 2012. Yet to be determined is how best to maintain services, including online databases. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In all, 14 positions were affected by the restructuring of Church House. Ten positions were eliminated. In some cases, staff were offered different or new positions; six staff received layoff notices. The next year will be used as a transitional year to evaluate the restructuring, said Archbishop Fred Hiltz, primate of the Anglican Church of Canada, in a meeting with staff. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The Partnerships department, from which four staff positions were eliminated, focused on three program areas--Partners in Mission, EcoJustice and the Anglican Healing Fund. The primate says this work will now be done in partnership with other churches and overseen by staff in two newly created positions: Henriette Thompson, formerly director of Partnerships, will assume a new role as coordinator of ecumenical, interfaith and government relations. Andrea Mann becomes the new coordinator of global relations within the Anglican Communion. </p>
