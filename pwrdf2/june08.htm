<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">To date, PWRDF has released $10,000 to ACT International for use by Amity Foundation in China, a member of ACT International, and $30,000 to ACT International for use by local organizations in Burma. We have recently received revised information from the government about matching donations from individual Canadians to the two above emergencies. Please check our website for specific information, but note that funds will only be matched for donations received between the following dates:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Burma Cyclone Relief Fund - May 2 - June 13<br>
    Sichuan Earthquake Relief Fund - May 12 - June 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Despite lack of humanitarian access and logistical challenges, members of ACT International were early in getting resources through to local organizations, providing clean water, emergency food and non-food items to more than 100,000 people in Myanmar.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF is concerned that donations have been slow to trickle in. It is impossible to quantify the extent of human suffering in these most recent disasters, so we look forward to your financial gifts that enable us to provide assistance as requested by ACT International. To read more about the magnitude of the emergencies please check our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.pwrdf.org/stories/all-stories/stories/?tx_ttnews[year]=2008&tx_ttnews[month]=05&tx_ttnews[day]=21&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=422&tx_ttnews[backPid]=1&cHash=c310f121da">website story</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Burma's other humanitarian crisis</strong> - Protracted armed conflict in eastern Burma has displaced over a million people during the past decade with over 140,000 people currently residing in refugee camps in Thailand. The international community has generously responded with basic food, shelter, health care and education needs for over 20 years, but there is concern over maintaining stability in the border areas with the current soaring global rice and oil prices. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF has many years of development experience in working with partners such as Women's League of Burma and Alternative Asean Network on Burma, and proud of our reputation of working with all ethnic groups in support of human rights and democracy in that country. Since the democracy uprising in 1988, many of the civil society groups who fled the country continue to defend democracy and citizens' rights from the border areas of Burma in Thailand. </p>

<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">2. <strong>Canadian Council for Refugees - 30 Years On</strong></h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Created in 1978, the Canadian Council for Refugees has established itself as the national voice on refugee protection and newcomer settlement in Canada. Over 30 years of existence, the CCR and its members have made a profound difference in the lives of refugees and immigrants. To celebrate, they would like help in (1) recruiting new members, (2) fundraising, (3) and educating the public about refugees and immigrants. To learn more or help out, you can contact Faith Shamonda at <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:ccr30@ccrweb.ca">ccr30@ccrweb.ca</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF staff attended the CCR Spring Consultation which took place in Winnipeg from May 22-24. The theme of the consultation, &quot;Our Past, Our Future: Our Children&quot;, was an opportunity to highlight how Canada is taking into account &quot;the best interest of the child&quot; as required in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">That CCR request to Canadian Immigration </p>
<ol style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.625em;">
  <li>To review the process for changing data such as birth date in identification papers, to make it faster and less difficult for children; </li>
  <li>To find alternative solutions to the request of having the other parent consent, when a parent who is a refugee or permanent resident in Canada is looking to reunify with its children, in particular in cases of domestic abuse. </li>
</ol>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Considering the burden that the immigration loans program poses on refugees, in particular those in most need, another important resolution was that CCR call upon the government to absorb the transportation and medical expenses for resettled refugees and dependents abroad, without reducing the total number of resettled refugees. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The consultation was also an opportunity for discussions and updates on the main campaigns. Among others, Proud to Aid and Abet Refugees; Implementation of Right to Appeal (Bill C280); Family Reunification; and Regularization of Non-status persons. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">For detailed information refer to CCR website <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="https://www.web.ca/ccr">www.web.ca/ccr</a></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">3. <em></em><strong>World Refugee Day - June 20</strong></h3>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The UNHCR has designated June 20 as World Refugee Day. As UNHCR reports, the refugee challenge in the 21st century is changing rapidly and people are forced to flee their homes for increasingly complicated reasons. Currently about 40 million people worldwide are already uprooted by violence and persecution, and it is likely that the future will see more people on the run as a growing number of factors compound one another to create conditions for further forced displacement.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Today people do not just flee persecution and war but also injustice, exclusion, environmental pressures, competition for scarce resources and all the miserable human consequences of dysfunctional states.</p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The task facing the international community in this environment is to find ways to unlock the potential of refugees who have so much to offer if they are given the opportunity to regain control over their lives. </p>
<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">As Antonio Guterres, on the occasion of World Refugee Day, 2007 noted: &quot;<em>World Refugee Day is the occasion to call attention to the millions of refugees and other displaced around the world and to their urgent needs, from water and shelter to protection and tolerance. Please join us in this effort. Whether in remote camps or in nearby neighbourhoods, there are always ways with which we can help them. It begins by remembering that they did not leave home by choice</em>&quot;</p>

<p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">National Aboriginal Day (Canada) is part of the annual nation-wide Celebrate Canada! Festivities held from June 21 - July 1 and is a day for all Canadians to celebrate the cultures and contributions to Canada of First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples. June 21 was chosen because of the cultural significance of the summer solstice (first day of summer and longest day of the year) and because many Aboriginal groups mark this day as a time to celebrate their heritage.</p>

The price rises are expected to reduce their program by at least 25%. They have received some additional funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).
