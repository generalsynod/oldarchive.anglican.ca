<h3>1. Cheryl Curtis, PWRDF's New Executive Director<a name="1"></a></h3>
<p>The Primate's Fund staff were happy to welcome Cheryl Curtis in mid-September
  as Executive Director. An experienced leader and manager Cheryl draws on strong
  experience in organizational development, supervision and teambuilding in accepting
  this new challenge. A skilled facilitator and informed educator, Cheryl is
  committed to education for transformation and is a valuable resource to both
  our partners and our constituency in Canada.</p>
<p>As a faithful ecumenist and interfaith ally Cheryl brings a depth and breadth
  to our organizational relationships. Well rooted in both local and global aspects
  of ministry, she brings wisdom and experience to The Primate's Fund and The
  Anglican Church of Canada.</p>
<p>Cheryl comes to PWRDF from the Toronto Conference office of The United Church
  of Canada where she held the Social Justice and Ethic Ministries portfolio.
  She also brings her experience as the Executive Director of the Working Group
  on Refugee Resettlement in Toronto.</p>
<h3>2. Emergency Response<a name="2"></a></h3>
<p>Hurricanes Katrina and Rita brought emergencies closer to home in September
  for Canadian Anglicans and staff of PWRDF. To date Canadian Anglicans have
  donated over $20,000 towards hurricane relief in the southern United States.</p>
<p>The Primate and PWRDF have committed Canadian Anglicans to ongoing prayer
  for the following church partners:<br>
  The Dioceses of Louisiana, Western Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee,
  Western Tennessee and Central Gulf Coast, their bishops, congregations, and
  the people of their cities and states affected by Hurricane Katrina, as people
  return to their communities and begin the long process of reconstruction</p>
<h4>Clinic Supported by PWRDF serves as Lifeline in Sudan</h4>
<p>Despite security problems, a clinic supported by Action by Churches Together
  (ACT) provided a vital lifeline to hundreds of people living in trouble-stricken
  South Darfur, Sudan. See complete story at <a href="http://www.pwrdf.org/news/news-db.php?news=268">http://www.pwrdf.org/news/news-db.php?news=268</a></p>
<h3>3. HIV/AIDS EVENTS<a name="3"></a></h3>
<p><strong>A Powerful Message About AIDS</strong></p>
<p>This summer St. Thomas, Belleville in the Diocese of Ontario held a church
  service with AIDS as the theme. Youth led the service. To illustrate the impact
  of the AIDS pandemic on communities in Africa, two grandmothers and a grandfather
  from the congregation were given 38 dolls to represent the 38 grandchildren
  they were left to raise after the deaths of their own children. The message
  was clear: this cannot continue!</p>
<p>Thank you St. Thomas for this illustration of raising awareness and funding
  for the Partnership for Life initiative. How can this stimulate other ideas
  and action? How can other parishes integrate this illustration into a service?</p>
<p><strong>PWRDF's Partnership for Life</strong></p>
<p>Your parish representative will be getting an AIDS packet to help your parish
  prepare for World AIDS Day, December 1st, 2005, and give ideas for continuing
  your involvement in PWRDF's Partnership for Life. It will include information
  on how to order our new AIDS bracelet, beaded pin and prayer card, a new AIDS
  poster, ideas on how to have an AIDS-focused church service, stories, and more.
  You will be receiving it by the end of October.</p>
<p>PWRDF is calling all Anglicans to continue working towards our goal to raise
  $1 million dollars by December 2006 for our work with partners against the
  HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p>
<h3>4. PWRDF Partner Receives Women's Rights Prize<a name="4"></a></h3>
<p>PWRDF partner The Women's League of Burma has recently been awarded the 2005
  Women's Rights Prize from the Peter Gruber Foundation. It comes with a nice
  plaque and a check for $200,000.</p>
<h3>5. PWRDF Partner Wins Award for Best Radio Development Program<a name="5"></a></h3>
<p>Do you remember the story in our Summer 2004 edition of Under the Sun about
  PWRDF partner FARDEC (Farmers Development Centre) when Mahjabeen Chowdhury
  was a guest on their radio program? We have recently heard that FARDEC received
  the award for Best Radio Development Program by the Catholic Mass Media Award.</p>
<h3>6. KAIROS Urges Inquiry into Murder of Congelese Human Rights Activist<a name="6"></a></h3>
<p>Pascal Kabungula Kibembi, executive director of Heritiers de la Justice, long
  term partner of PWRDF, was shot dead in front of his family on July 31. Heritiers
  de la Justice staff have reported grave human rights abuses by armed groups
  and have been critical of DRC government inaction. KAIROS has written to foreign
  Affairs Minister Pettigrew urging an independent investigation with copies
  to relevant diplomatic stakeholders in Canada and the DRC. The letter is posted
  on the KAIROS website:<br>

<h3>9. Partnerships in Latin America<a name="9"></a></h3>
<p>From our Latin America Desk - &quot;It can take many years to become an overnight
  success.&quot; - In for the long haul with PWRDF partners in Latin America.</p>
<p>Many PWRDF partners know what it means to work for change over the long haul.
  For indigenous women's organizations in Latin America this is especially true
  as they face the challenges that come with being three-times marginalized:
  poor, indigenous and women. That they hang in for so many years, hoping for
  any small overnight success, is both a miracle and an inspiration to those
  of us who are privileged to accompany them.</p>
<p>In July of this year, PWRDF Latin America/Caribbean coordinator, Suzanne Rumsey
  visited partners in Guatemala and Mexico. In the tiny hamlet of Labor de Falla,
  she met with local members of the Women's Ecumenical Network, supported by
  the Conference of Evangelical Churches of Guatemala (CIEDEG). Dressed in their
  beautiful woven &quot;trajes&quot; (skirt and blouse), they quietly shared
  how they survived the genocide of Guatemala's 36-year civil war - and how many
  of their family members did not.</p>
<p>In her trip report, Suzanne notes: &quot;It was out of this experience of
  extreme violence that in 1982 they began to organize themselves. Support from
  the Kaqchikel Presbytery (the Mayan Presbyterian church) followed. When I asked
  the women to describe what successes they have had over the years, the first
  one they described was overcoming their own fear and the resistance of their
  husbands to leave the house and become involved in an organized women's group.
  The issue of the lack of support, even resistance and denial of &quot;permission&quot; to
  participate, became a recurring theme in all of the meetings I had with Guatemalan
  women. Not for the first time it caused me to question the viability of women's
  development in a context where gender discrimination begins and remains entrenched
  at home.&quot;</p>
<p>  But the fact that 23 years later these women continue to meet, to support one
  another, to organize and to participate in larger networks and coalitions is
  testimony to their quiet strength in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
  Suzanne goes on to note: &quot;Through the Network the women have received
  workshops on a variety of themes; everything from family violence and women's
  self-esteem to free trade agreements and their impacts on local economies.
  Despite a lack of formal education, when describing free trade they were able
  to make the links between agreements negotiated by governments and how those
  agreements affect them. The women have also participated in marches and events
  that have brought together women from throughout Guatemala in relation to these
  themes. They described the sense of solidarity they experience; of being part
  of something larger, and of the importance of the friendships and mutual support
  they have gained both locally and nationally.&quot;</p>
<p>In Mexico, K'inal Antzetik is carrying out pioneering work in Mexican indigenous
  communities to address issues related to women's health and in particular,
  the high rates of maternal mortality. Suzanne wrote in her trip report that, &quot;In
  recent years, K'inal's work has been centred in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca
  and Guerrero, three states with a significant indigenous population and with
  many of the poorest municipalities in the country. Last year K'inal, working
  with governmental health agencies (virtually no NGOs operate in the region),
  established a &quot;Casa de Salud&quot; (Health Centre) for indigenous women
  in one of Guerrero's poorest municipalities - San Lu&iacute;s Acatl&aacute;n.
  The Casa serves as an intermediary centre for women from remote communities
  whose pregnancies and deliveries have been determined to be high risk by health
  promoters linked to K'inal, and the municipality's hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;K'inal has faced many challenges in establishing the Casa, including
  uneven government financing, resistance from husbands who do not wish their
  wives to leave their communities, and a lack of medical staff trained to work
  inter-culturally. But significant advances have been made and in May of this
  year, K'inal, together with the Centre for Analysis and Investigation (FUNDAR)
  convoked a forum on maternal health in Guerrero entitled &quot;Prevention of
  Maternal Mortality in Mexico: And the Indigenous Women?&quot;. At its conclusion
  a formal agreement was signed between the participating NGOs, federal and state
  governmental agencies and the Mexican Congress for a comprehensive maternal
  health program for Guerrero, the first of its kind in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>An &quot;overnight success&quot; can indeed be many years in the making. But
  the persistence of indigenous women in Guatemala and NGOs like K'inal shows
  us that such success is possible.</p>
<h3>10. Book Review - Betrayed: The Assassination of Digna Ochoa by Linda Diebel<a name="10"></a></h3>
<p>Betrayed: The Assassination of Digna Ochoa - by Linda Diebel - The Murder
  of a High-Profile Human Rights Activist and the ensuing cover-up in the Mexican
  Government</p>
<p>Suzanne Rumsey, Development Program Coordinator, Latin American and the Caribbean,
  writes:</p>
<p>&quot;During the decade that I worked on behalf of the Canadian churches in
  Mexico and Central America, a number of colleagues in the human rights community
  paid the ultimate price of speaking truth to power, among them, Digna Ochoa.
  Digna spoke truth to power and defended those at the margins of Mexican society.
  Her assassination, the first of a prominent human rights defender in Mexico
  in over a decade, and the first under the so-called &quot;democracy&quot; of
  the Fox administration, was a tremendous blow, both personally and professionally
  to her colleagues in the Mexican human rights community and to those of us
  in the international community who accompany our partners in Mexico. The impunity
  that this case still enjoys speaks truth to power about the continuing state
  of democracy in Mexico. As another Mexican colleague once put it: &quot;We
  are only starting to learn how to someday become democratic&quot;.</p>
<p>In writing and publishing Digna's story, Linda Diebel continues to speak truth
  to power just as she did during her tenure in Mexico. From a 1994 report on
  human rights in Mexico, Inter-Church Committee on Human Rights in Latin America
  (ICCHRLA), a quote from an article written by Linda describes the North American
  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as &quot;the death certificate for the indigenous
  people of Mexico&quot;. From the Toronto Star, April 1995 in which it is revealed
  that both the Mexican authorities and CSIS are investigating human rights defenders: &quot;Mexico
  blacklists priest from Canada as rebel ally&quot;. And from the Toronto Star,
  April, 2001, reporting on a Canadian church leaders' delegation to northern
  Mexico: &quot;Mexicans pay price for NAFTA&quot;.</p>
<p>Speaking truth to power can be difficult, at times costly. Human rights defenders
  and journalists know this. Digna knew this. Linda knows this. And those of
  us in the Canadian churches who collaborated with these two women over the
  years, owe them a very large debt of gratitude, as we too continue to seek
  ways to speak truth to power, with and on behalf of those at the margins of
  our societies and our economies.&quot;</p>
