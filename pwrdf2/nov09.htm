    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em><strong>One Voice CD</strong></em><br>
    One Voice&mdash;a magical double CD set of inspiration and celebration is a gift that Anglicans can be proud to share with family and friends at Christmas or anytime. More information and the full track list is available on our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf50.org/one-voice-cd">50th anniversary website</a>. 100% of the proceeds of the CD go to support the work of PWRDF partners in Canada and around the world. To place your order, contact Jennifer Brown at 416-924-9199 ext 320 or <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:jbrown@pwrdf.org">jbrown@pwrdf.org</a>. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">We had a recent glitch with our mailing company that found some congregations with double orders of CDs. We certainly commend everyone's creativity when faced with this issue! Diocese of Saskatoon Representative Mary Ann Assailly, was able to sell 70 CDs more than she ordered! The Church of the Epiphany in Rimbey, AB will be giving popcorn balls with each CD as an extra incentive for folks to buy them! Thanks to everyone that is getting behind this very exciting project!</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em><strong>From Cookies to Champagne</strong></em><br>
      We are hoping that each Ecclesiastical Province will hold 50 PWRDF anniversary events&mdash;anything from a church school sponsored tea party to a gala dinner, and everything in between! To get some ideas based on events that have already happened, check out our <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf50.org/cookies-to-champagne">Cookies to Champagne page</a>.

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;"><em><strong>Refugee Sponsorship</strong></em><br>
      We are at around the halfway mark towards our goal of sponsoring 50 refugee families in parishes and dioceses across Canada. Recent arrivals include a family from Colombia who was welcomed to Winnipeg and two Palestinian families from Iraq who were welcomed to Halifax. For more information on how your parish can sponsor a refugee family, contact your diocesan refugee coordinator or Carolyn Vanderlip at 416-924-9199 ext 266 or <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="mailto:cvanderlip@pwrdf.org">cvanderlip@pwrdf.org</a>. </p>

      World AIDS Day&mdash;December 1st</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">December 1st marks the 21st Anniversary of World AIDS Day. While treatment for HIV and AIDS has improved and become more widespread since 1988, there are those who still do not have access to it. Stigma and discrimination continue to be a threat to universal access. PWRDF continues to work with partners around the world on issues of HIV and AIDS. You will find <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf.org/stories/stories-by-theme/hivaids-stories/">stories of our work</a> on our website as well as part of the <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf.org/stories/stories-by-type/voices-of-hope-pew-bulletin-stories/">Voices of Hope Stories</a> that are released weekly on the website.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The international climate change talks are set to start in Copenhagen in December, and Earth's future is at stake. It's time for us to do everything we can to ensure that Canada takes a progressive stance at these negotiations, and that the world community emerges from Copenhagen with a just, binding, science-based climate treaty. <br>
      <br>
      Brothers and sisters around the globe are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate injustice&mdash;show your solidarity with God's peoples and the Earth!<br>
      <br>
      <strong>What can you do?</strong> <strong>RING YOUR BELLS!</strong><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      KAIROS is asking every church in the country to ring its church bells 350 times for climate justice on Sunday December 13, 2009 at 3:00pm (your local time zone). Sunday December 13 is a day of action for churches around the world. A global bell ringing action is timed to coincide with an ecumenical service that the World Council of Churches is coordinating at the height of the talks in Copenhagen. When it ends at 3:00 pm, churches all over Denmark will ring their bells.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">If churches around the world ring their bells at 3:00 pm local time, we'll have a 24 hour chain of bells! Can't manage at 3:00? How about when church ends? That way your entire church community can be involved!</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Why church bells? Why 350 times? For answers to these questions and details, <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.kairoscanada.org/en/ecojustice/climate-change/copenhagen-2009/ring-350-for-copenhagen/">click here</a>.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In October 2009, PWRDF<strong> </strong>started to support the Anglican Church of Kenya&mdash;Directorate of Social Services with a project targeting eight areas in Makueni, Kitui, Mwingi and Laikipia Districts of Kenya. These areas have suffered, over the last two years, persistent drought, crop failure and high food prices which have broken down people's capacity to access food. With an emergency grant of $210,000, half of which comes from the Canadian Foodgrains Bank, the project aims to alleviate the suffering of 2,000 vulnerable households by providing half rations of food support for three months, utilizing 240 tonnes of maize, 48 tonnes of beans, and 11 tonnes of oil. Thanks to the financial gifts of Anglicans in Canada and the Canadian Foodgrains Bank PWRDF is supporting partners to respond to these devastating challenges.</p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">6.  Humanitarian Response for El Salvador</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">On November 8, as much rain fell on El Salvador in four hours as in four days of Hurricane Mitch in 1998. This national tragedy has taken the lives of 120 people and left thousands homeless. The areas hardest hit are five departments in the central and central-eastern parts of the country: San Vicente, La Libertad, San Salvador, Cuscatl&aacute;n, and La Paz. Three other departments&mdash;Usulut&aacute;n, Chalatenango and San Miguel&mdash;also report damage and loss of life.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF is responding with an initialemergency response grant of $15,000. ACT Forum El Salvador, in close cooperation with the round table of churches, is mapping the needs and preparing a common response. The forum plans to put out an appeal proposal which will include food, cooking utensils and hygiene kits. <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.canadahelps.org/CharityProfilePage.aspx?CharityID=s50860">Click here</a> to make a secure online donation to PWRDF that will help fund this response.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF was proud to host a visit to Canada by Edmond Bayisabe, the youth coordinator for the Anglican Diocese of Bujumbura. PWRDF has partnered with the Diocese since 1992, and the visits from the <em>just</em>generation.ca youth delegation to Burundi in February and now Edmond's visit to Canada have been fantastic opportunities to build connections between Anglicans in Canada and our partners in Burundi.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">The fact that the Canadian refugee system is in crisis is nothing new. This is a message that refugee protection workers, lawyers, service providers and refugees have been speaking for years. However, the government proposed remedies are not addressing the main issues identified by these concerned communities. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">PWRDF is looking for ways to contribute to a dialogue with the government regarding Canada's principles and practices concerning refugee protection and to contribute to Canada's refugee protection. In this we are not alone. We work in collaboration with the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR) umbrella organization of which we are members, and with the Anglican Diocesan Refugee Coordinators across the country. </p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">From November 30th to December 5th, several meetings are taking place to address various issues of concern in relation to policies and practices applicable to Canadian Refugees. PWRDF is having a meeting with diocesan refugee coordinators to look at how to strengthen our collective work. The private sponsorship agreement holder's community from across Canada is also meeting for two days to discuss their roles in the refugee sponsorship program and how it can be strengthened. The CCR is having its annual Fall Consultation in Windsor, where CCR members will identify networking, information exchange, and advocacy directions for strengthening the Canadian Refugee System. Check out <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.pwrdf.org/our-work/relief-refugee-program/refugees/">PWRDF Refugee program</a>, or <a style="color: rgb(187, 68, 0);" href="http://www.ccrweb.ca">CCR</a> for more information on the specific issues, upcoming events and outcomes of the upcoming meetings.</p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">9. Local Heroes</h3>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">St. Christopher's Anglican Church is located in Haines Junction, Yukon, a town with a population of 800. The thrift shop at the church was started in approximately 1980. In 1991, after a move from the rectory basement, the basement of the church became the thrift shop's new home.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">In 1991/1992 a decision was made to send the proceeds of the shop to PWRDF for one year. Although there was a temptation to use the funds for local expenses, the funds have continued to be sent to PWRDF. Annually approximately $2000 to $2500 is sent to PWRDF. Over the years, the thrift shop has raised over $40,000 that has funded PWRDF partner work around the world!</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Initially, the thrift shop was stocked with used clothes and newly knitted items from the ACW Memorial House in Vancouver (a service given to the Diocese of Yukon since 1926). Today the thrift shop is supported solely by local donations.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">This incredible work has been the passion of primarily three women, longtime residents of the community&mdash;the late Tish Tomlin, Barb Henkel and Libbie Dulac. Over the years many other members of the congregation have helped out as well.</p>
    <p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 1.5em; line-height: 1.5em;">Thanks to St. Christopher's for being committed to the work of PWRDF!</p><h3 style="border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(187, 170, 153); font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 1.15em; margin-bottom: 0.625em; padding-bottom: 0.25em;">Thank you for supporting The Primate's World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF)</h3>
