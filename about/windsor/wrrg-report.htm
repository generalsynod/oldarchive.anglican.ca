                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
  	<h2><strong>The Response Group</strong></h2>
  	<p>The group met in Oakville on January 26 and 27, to read the Canadian responses to the Windsor Report and to prepare a summary for the Primate. Members were chosen from the Partners in Mission Committee, the Faith Worship and Ministry Committee, and the House of Bishops. They included Dr. Patricia Bays (Ottawa) the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d Michael Bedford-Jones (Toronto), the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d Peter Coffin (Ottawa), the Rev&rsquo;d Dr. Tim Connor (Huron), the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d Jim Cowan (British Columbia), Ms. Cynthia Haines-Turner (Western Newfoundland), the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d Colin Johnson (Toronto) and Canon Linda Nicholls (Toronto). Staff support was provided by Dr. Eleanor Johnson with the assistance of Canon Alyson Barnett-Cowan, Archdeacon Jim Boyles, and Archdeacon Paul Feheley.</p>
  	<p><strong>The responses</strong></p>
  	<p>Canadian Anglicans were asked by the Primate to send in responses to the Windsor Report. By the time of the meeting, 171 responses had been received. 9 were from dioceses, 87 from laity, 51 from clergy, 13 from groups of clergy and laity, and 11 could not be identified as to order.&nbsp; The group was delighted with the large number of lay people who responded. Responses came from all ecclesiastical provinces (17 from Canada, 58 from Ontario, 34 from Rupert&rsquo;s Land, 36 from British Columbia and Yukon, and 20 could not be identified as to geography).&nbsp; On a spectrum from those most concerned to preserve the present practice of the Anglican Church (1) to those most open to change (5), the following was identified:</p>
  	<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">1 &ndash; 44</td>
        <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">2 &ndash; 28</td>
        <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">3 &ndash; 29</td>
        <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">4 &ndash; 41</td>
        <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">5 &ndash; 24</td>
        <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">Can&rsquo;t tell &ndash; 3</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
  	<p>Since January 26, other responses have come in. They have been read but the numbers are not reflected in the above statistics. The responses covered the whole spectrum of opinion within the Canadian church. The majority of the responses dealt with questions about homosexuality and the authority of scripture. Again, opinion covered a broad range. A smaller number of responses (about a quarter of the total number) dealt directly with the Windsor Report and the four questions prepared by the Primates&rsquo; Meeting.</p>
  	
  	<h2>The process</h2>
  	<p>The response group, including staff, divided into 6 groups of 2. The responses were divided into packets of equal length. Each group was asked to read the responses in their packet, record statistical information, and make a note of themes, concerns and quotes. Every response received by Wednesday evening (January 26) was read by two people. We looked also at a response from the Council of General Synod, and a report on the discussion held at the House of Bishops meeting. The task force then drew out themes from what they had read. Finally we looked at the four questions (see below) and tried to summarize responses, using direct quotes as examples.</p>

  	<p><strong>The four questions</strong> formulated by the Primates&rsquo; Standing Committee</p>
  	
  	<ol>
      <li><strong>What in the description of the life of the Communion (A &amp; B) can you recognize as consistent, or not, with your understanding of the Anglican Communion?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  	<p>There were many expressions of thanks to the Commission for the work that they had done.</p>
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The Commission is to be commended on having produced a unanimous Report under very difficult circumstances. We affirm whole-heartedly the assertion that our communion with one another is a gift from God.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Overall, I think the report is excellent, and the Commission is to be congratulated on a thorough and persuasive presentation, and particularly for stating the scriptural and historic authority for what it says. I believe it correctly analyses the internal causes of our present problems, although it does not touch upon the external (e.g. the rapid change in Western mores in the past 50 years which other regions have, unsurprisingly, not yet followed.)&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Responses varied as to the accuracy of the description of the life of the Communion. Some said that this was a good description of Anglicanism. Others expressed concern that the ecclesiology described does not match their historical understanding of it. One said that the description was &ldquo;a somewhat rosy view of Anglicanism, given its history of sectarianism and political factionalism.&rdquo; </p>
  	<p>There were a number of concerns about the material in sections A and B. Many felt that more exploration was needed around words like autonomy, interdependence, and adiaphora.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;Although there is a scriptural basis to the Report, many of the terms used are not scriptural, e.g. autonomy, adiaphora, subsidiarity. It seems to us that the key biblical concept we need to affirm is that of the Body of Christ. There should be more emphasis on the world-wide Body of Christ, and on ways in which this understanding of our church and churches could be enhanced.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<h3>Biblical foundations</h3>
  	<p>There was approval for beginning with an examination of the biblical foundations.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;We appreciated the close and logical nature of the reasoning the report, especially in the passages on Scripture.&rdquo; </p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p>&ldquo;The report&rsquo;s description of the fundamental character of the church, drawing on Ephesians and 1 and 2 Corinthians, portraying the church as &ldquo;the practical embodiment and fruit of the gospel&rdquo;, is one we enthusiastically endorse. We agree that the &ldquo;redeemed unity which is God&rsquo;s will for the whole creation is to be lived out within the life of the church.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;We strongly affirm and support the conclusions of the Windsor Report, and its approach to the importance of the continued integrity of the world-wide Anglican Communion. We acknowledge and especially appreciate the emphasis that the Windsor Report placed on Scripture as the Church&rsquo;s supreme authority and basis for unity.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Other responses raised concerns about the choice of texts.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;There seems to be a concentration on the Pauline epistles, with no quotations from the Gospels or Acts or elsewhere. For example, Jesus&rsquo; treatment of the topic of divorce, or the apostles&rsquo; handling of the reception of Gentiles into the church, might usefully have been referred to.&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The theological reflection begins in #1 with the fact of sin, and moves very quickly to the reality of division. Sin seems to be understood on the model of the Babel story as alienation and division. It would be fruitful to contrast this with a reflection beginning with creation, in which the rich diversity of the Trinity overflows into all creation. Such a model would first of all celebrate diversity, rather than see it as a threat or punishment.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>There was a plea for more education around the Scriptures, and a commendation of paragraph 67 which expresses a need for us to read Scripture together. &ldquo;One of the hallmarks of healthy worldwide communion will be precisely our readiness to learn from one another (which by no means indicates an unquestioning acceptance of one another&rsquo;s readings but rather a rich mutual accountability) as we read scripture together.&rdquo;</p>
  	<h3>The ordination of women</h3>
  	<p>The description of the procedure followed in bringing about the ordination of women provoked a good deal of response. In general, it was felt that the Windsor Report describes the story of the ordination of women to the priesthood from the perspective of bishops and decision makers, and not from the perspective of women. We need to acknowledge the pain and the cost that is involved in our decision making process, both in the past and the present.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The example given as a model of decision-making, namely the ordination of women and the consecration of women to the episcopate, is idealized. It was nowhere near as smooth as the Report makes out, and it is still a source of conflict in the world-wide church.&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p>&ldquo;The section entitled &ldquo;Recent Mutual Discernment within the Communion&rdquo; (12-21) is a breath taking re-writing of Anglican history that few women would recognize as either helpful or appropriate. In the midst of a pastoral crisis in 1944 Bishop Hall did not consult the &ldquo;Instruments of Unity&rdquo; and, in fact, was roundly condemned by them all prior to the Anglican Consultative Council in Kenya almost thirty years later. Despite censure and pressure from Lambeth 1948 and two successive Archbishops of Canterbury, Bishop Hall did not deprive Li Tim-Oi of her priestly orders; she surrendered her license. In light of the terrible suffering that Li Tim-Oi underwent during the Cultural Revolution and of her rejection by the Anglican Communion, the use of her experience as an example of the effective working of the various instruments of unity is, to say the least, disrespectful of a courageous woman.&rdquo;</p>
  	    <p>&ldquo;The real lesson derived from the history of the ordination of women is that having the need for unity and fellowship as the first priority results in the endless postponement of decision-making and inequitable treatment for those most closely involved.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;This section of the report shows that the Anglican Church of Canada is already in impaired communion with many Provinces, even though all the appropriate steps were followed. If we can exist with a measure of impairment on this issue [ordination of women and of persons divorced and remarried], why can we not now exist with a similar measure of impairment?&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	      <p>&ldquo;The report argues that there is no precedent in Scripture and tradition for the ordination to the episcopate of gays/lesbians and the blessing of their union. Was there any such precedent for the ordination of women or for the remarriage of divorced persons? Lambeth 1968 dealt with this question when it pointed to the dynamic nature of tradition with the words, </p>
        <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
  	        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;If the ancient and medieval role and inferior status of women are no longer accepted, the appeal to tradition is virtually reduced to the observation that there happens to be no precedent for ordaining women to be priests. The New Testament does not encourage Christians to think that nothing should be done for the first time.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<h3>Authority of Scripture</h3>
  	<p>There was a wide range of views on the authority of Scripture. There were statements about the supreme authority of Scripture and insistence that the words of Scripture be followed exactly as read. A number of responses indicated a strong belief that the blessing of same sex unions is forbidden by the Scriptures, and there is a concern that, in some of its recent decisions, the Anglican Church is departing from the Scriptures.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;How can I remain true to orthodox Anglicanism under the authority of leadership that appears to challenge the Scripture?&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;How can those of us who consider the Bible as God&rsquo;s true Word be one in Christ with those who are interpreting Scripture to fit in with worldly agendas?&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>There were also responses which called for a more nuanced reading of Scripture in the light of contemporary scholarship and the changing life of church and society. Some responses encouraged the church to look at the gospel&rsquo;s message of inclusion. </p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;We felt it might be important to explore some of Jesus&rsquo; own teaching, particularly passages such as the High Priestly prayer and those passages that speak of inclusivity in the life of the faith community. Indeed, there are other Pauline passages on inclusivity that might be quoted.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>One response directed our attention to the way the apostles made decisions on how biblical laws and mores were to be applied, particularly in the case of admitting new members to the church. &ldquo;The unwavering example of Jesus was and is to look beyond the rules to the people for whom the rules are made.&rdquo; </p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The apostolic example warns us not to prejudge the answer. Nor does it leave the answer to those whose lifestyle is in question. It names two or three trusted senior leaders representing opposite positions to study together whatever texts they deem relevant to the case before them, to examine witnesses to the presence of the Holy Spirit in the lives of those asking a blessing, and to pronounce what minimum rules for bestowing a blessing should apply.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>There was some question about the statement &ldquo;The Anglican Communion has always declared that its supreme authority is Scripture.&rdquo; Some saw this statement as a departure from Anglican tradition.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;In fact, Anglicanism from its early days has looked to a balanced authority. Richard Hooker said that Scripture must always be read in the light of tradition and reason. The Bible goes hand in hand with Tradition &ndash; the historic creeds, the collective wisdom of the church throughout the ages. This is perhaps more of an emphasis of the catholic side of Anglicanism. The Bible is always to be interpreted in the light of reason. Anglicans tend to use current scholarship to interpret the scriptures, and reject a narrow literalist understanding of the Bible. As well, Anglican scholarship has always studied and used where appropriate contemporary scientific knowledge. This was evident, for example, in the challenge to traditional Anglican thought of Darwin and the new science of the 19th century. We should be wary of forcing a narrow understanding of authority on the Communion.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<h3>Making decisions in the Communion</h3>
  	<p>There was felt to be a need to define autonomy and interdependence, and there were questions about how decisions have been made in the past. Traditionally as Anglicans we have not decided much on the communion level but rather on the diocesan and provincial levels.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The description of the life of the Communion does not reflect any recognition of the respect one Province ought to have for synodical decisions of another Province. Canadian Anglicans have long tolerated positions taken in other Provinces which do not reflect their own positions. The issue of women as Bishops is an easy example of that tolerance. It is not merely a matter of <em>adiaphora</em> but a reflection of the authoritative foundation of decisions made by the Canadian Church which ought to be given more weight than positions espoused by provinces without that authority.&rdquo;</p>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The synodical decisions made by the Diocese of New Westminster and General Synod, which are dealt with in the Report, are decisions of the kind of substantial authority I have in mind. I would submit that what is missing from Parts A and B of the Report is a recognition that at least until recently, Canadian Anglicans expected that the Commission would recognize the significance of those synodical decisions and respect them as more authoritative than pronouncements from Communion-wide bodies newly labeled as Instruments of Unity. For example, I would regard the synodical decisions of ECUSA as more persuasive and influential in the Canadian Church than the pronouncements of a Primate of a Province made without consultation with a Synod.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Reference was made to the fact that the Communion has in fact changed its mind on occasion, in the discussion of contraception at the Lambeth Conferences of 1920 and 1930, and in the discussion of the ordination of women.</p>
  	<ol>
      <li value="2"><strong>In what ways do the proposals in C and D flow appropriately from the description of the Communion&rsquo;s life in A and B?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  	<p>Again, responses varied. Some supported the instruments of unity as described in the Windsor Report.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;I am pleased that the Commission supports the work of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lambeth Conference, the Anglican Consultative Council and the Primates&rsquo; Meetings as the mean of unity and the working of that same Holy Spirit. I do not fear that the support of these instruments will diminish the gains we as a communion have made. In fact, the use of these instruments has caused us to grow in the spirit of justice and truth in Christ.&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I believe that, with proper care, the instruments of unity can effectively be used for the building up of the body of the communion without the use of a covenant. If we shore up the existing Instruments of Unity, we will move beyond the individualism of this age, not losing our diversity, but finding the common call we have in Christ for the world.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>On the other hand, other responses were concerned about the dangers of a greater centralization of authority.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The main proposals presented in the Report would seem to call a halt to this development in synodical governance, replacing it with a trend to centralize authority in small bodies operating at the highest levels of the Communion, and not necessarily involving laity. We thus regard them with some hesitation.&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;There seems to be a slide into a corporate organizational model, versus the <em>consensus fidelium</em>. We believe that there should be freedom and even encouragement to stretch the boundaries, which is an exciting adventure and a way in which the church discovers new leading from the Holy Spirit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Report concentrates on developing rules of procedure in decision-making, whereas the urgent need is to find ways of fostering our bonds of affection, that is, our mutual love, and of finding new and improved ways of being together. It is more important to concentrate on improving the bonds of affection within the Communion than on clarifying authority and process.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>There was concern about the proposed Council of Advice.</p>
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;If it is seen as a permanent body, would it not simply add yet one more bureaucratic level to the mix? A group of specialist advisers can be called together by the Archbishop of Canterbury to consider any issue whenever he or she wishes, and the right to do this might be spelled out in the Covenant. The proposed permanent Council smacks to us of being a kind of &ldquo;creeping Curia.&rdquo;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The proposed Council of Advice appears to lack any ecclesiological significance, and it actually hampers the role of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who already has a formal staff at Lambeth Palace. What is proposed seems to be nearly a curia, and not one that necessarily enables the episcopal ministry of the successor to St. Augustine, but which may well dictate and control it.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>There was some concern over strengthening the role of the Archbishop of Canterbury when this is an appointment of the British Crown. Should the Archbishop be appointed from elsewhere in the Communion? In some of the responses, there was a real resistance to &ldquo;English&rdquo; and &ldquo;colonial&rdquo; style.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;Often assumptions and attitudes from the British colonial period colour our conversations with each other in ways that we do not always acknowledge. . . Another visible sign of post-colonialism can be seen in the Church of England&rsquo;s blithe assumption that, until it has agreed to a particular innovation (like the ordination of women), the change really hasn&rsquo;t happened.&rdquo;</p>
  	  <blockquote>
  	    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;We also note that the Commission has chosen not to question the inherent structure of the current Instruments of Unity nor to examine the implications of the historic relationship between the Archbishop of Canterbury and the British Crown as it pertains to issues of accountability within our wider Communion. The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations suggest a desire to entrench existing mechanisms, rather than to address the possibility of the need for systemic reform.&rdquo;</p>
          
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>There was concern that the provision of alternative episcopal oversight is a departure from the Anglican tradition of bishops not intervening in other dioceses. </p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;If there is to be provision for alternative episcopal oversight, it must work both ways so that those in favour of the blessing same-sex unions can be assured of pastoral care.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>The &ldquo;Shared Episcopal Ministry&rdquo; statement of the Canadian House of Bishops speaks about the need for episcopal oversight that works both ways. It says, &ldquo;It would be important to have a number of bishops from different theological perspectives so that all parishes requesting Shared Episcopal Ministry might be served.&rdquo;</p>
  	<p>Opinions differed on the &ldquo;expressions of regret.&rdquo; Some felt that New Westminster and New Hampshire had made decisions according to the canons of their provinces and so had done nothing for which they needed to express regret. </p>
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how any part of the church should be expected to apologize for having taken actions which were in total compliance with the legal requirement of the church (province and diocese), and which faithfully followed the leading and guidance of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	
  	<p>Others felt that their statements of regret had not gone far enough. </p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;For any expressions of &lsquo;regret&rsquo; to be meaningful we also look for them to be accompanied by substantial actions, including the &ldquo;withdrawal from representative positions . . . &rdquo; and &ldquo;turning away from policies. . . &ldquo; which have been variously called for. We deeply regret that we have not seen any indication that this is likely to happen. To the contrary, several key North American Church leaders have blatantly assured the media that they intend to continue their policies and practices.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Some pointed out that, though we have expressions of regret from some bishops, we have not yet heard expressions of regret from bishops who have intervened in other dioceses.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;If listening, respect and dialogue are to be the hallmarks of communion, then I would hope that this might be exercised on all sides of the debate. We have not yet heard expressions of regret from all involved.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<ol>
      <li value="3"><strong>What do you think are the ways in which the recommendations and proposals of the Report would impact on the life of the Communion if they were to be implemented?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  	<p>A large number of responses were concerned over increasing centralization, as illustrated by the examples above. A smaller minority of reports felt that the recommendations would strengthen the life of the Communion.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The recommendations, if followed by all parties, could well be a way in which the communion could move forward together. No one wants the Anglican Communion to dissolve, and the moves suggested could signal to all parties enough good will on both sides that the next step would be possible.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Many were concerned about the provision of delegated episcopal oversight.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The whole idea of bishops entering the jurisdiction of another bishop is contrary to Anglican tradition and practice, and is a threat to the authority of the bishop in his/her diocese. While it has been tried in the Church of England, there has been no evaluation as to how this has worked. Did the Church of England seek the approval of the Communion before instituting what is clearly a departure from customary Anglican practice?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Some wonder how the situation can be resolved in the light of our history.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The result of proceeding in the fashion set out in the Report is just as likely to be destructive as constructive, since some parts of the Communion are entrenched in their positions on either side of the current question. Rocks have been thrown from both sides, and this could well intensify. The Instruments of Unity have already spoken clearly on this issue over a period of decades, and their statements have not been awarded the weight due to them, so how are further consultations and pronouncements likely to resolve the issue?&rdquo;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;The discussion of procedures gives me pause. There is a danger that legalisms and systems will take precedence over open theological discussion. There is the danger of a bureaucratic approach which can kill the spirit &ndash; &ldquo;for the letter kills but the spirit gives life.&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	
  	<p>There were not many comments on the moratoria. From some, there was affirmation of the call for moratoria. </p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;We approve of the moratoria suggested (143), will observe them ourselves, and commend them to others. We will not pass motions that will challenge the spirit of them.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>Some expressed relief that the synods of Toronto and Niagara did not proceed to implement a resolution on the blessing of same sex unions. A few felt that the moratoria on the blessing of same sex unions did not go far enough. They felt that there was no point in asking for expressions of regret from those who were not sorry for their actions. A few felt that there should be no moratorium on the intervention of bishops in other jurisdictions.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The call to bishops who have intervened in other jurisdictions to express regret, affirm their desire to remain in the Communion, and effect a moratorium on further interventions (155) is an insult to those orthodox leaders who have come to the aid of clergy and parishes who were indeed in situations of extreme breach of trust and saw this action as a last resort (151).&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
  	<p>On the other hand, questions were raised about the definition of a moratorium. Is there a time limit? Some thought that a moratorium on the blessing of same-sex unions would be a step backward.</p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;While I respect the mandate of the Windsor Report to focus on &ldquo;understandings of communion and practical recommendations for maintaining communion,&rdquo; there are parts of our communion that have seemingly been ignored. First, our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters were beginning to experience a sense of hope. Now, by suggesting putting a moratorium on blessing same-sex unions we are asking many to take a step backwards.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The request for a moratorium should be carefully considered, but I would suggest that it would only be appropriate if there is evidence that it would serve a purpose, specifically if there were evidence of a real willingness on all sides to use the time for dialogue and learning.&rdquo;</p>

      <li value="4"><strong>How would you evaluate the arguments for an Anglican Covenant (119)? How far do the elements included in the possible draft for such a covenant in Appendix Two of the Report represent an appropriate development of the existing life of the Anglican Communion?</strong></li>
  </ol>
  	<p>Again, there was a variety of opinion. Some felt that the Covenant was a good idea. </p>
  	<blockquote>
  	  <p>&ldquo;The idea of Covenant is a good one which needs to be carefully worked out within the context of a global Anglican Communion.&rdquo;</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;It seems to us that the argument for an Anglican Covenant is very strong. We agree that the Anglican Communion, even if it were to survive this crisis, would not likely survive many further such crises, and so there needs to be a voluntary expression of the will to maintain the bonds of unity. The agreement proposed is a good starting point. However, we are dubious that any such agreement could be reached without first finding a more concrete and detailed unifying statement about the authority of Scripture to be a part of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	
  	<p>Some referred to our Covenant with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada as a model. Most in responding felt that the Covenant proposed in the Windsor Report is too detailed in its proposals and feared the development of a complex bureaucratic structure that will stifle change.</p>
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The proposal for a Covenant is good in principle, but all depends on how directive the content is, and where its main focus lies. It seems to many of us that a simple Covenant, affirming and exploring our desire to live and work together, would be more acceptable than the detailed &lsquo;legalistic&rsquo; document suggested, which may not give room for the Holy Spirit to work. There is a general feeling among us that the five-part outline of the suggested Covenant is acceptable, but that the actual suggested wording is far too complex and indigestible. It should be drastically shortened and simplified.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;The draft in appendix 2 is unacceptably proscriptive and envisages a highly centralized Communion under the direction of the &ldquo;Instruments of Unity&rdquo; which now include the &ldquo;Council of Advice&rdquo;. The Primates&rsquo; Meeting &lsquo;monitors global developments and exercises collegial responsibility in doctrinal, moral and pastoral matters&rsquo;. (Article 24) Clearly this leaves room for only very limited provincial autonomy.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;There is a risk that such a covenant could be used as a tool for &ldquo;cutting off&rdquo; dissenters when major disagreements arise.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>Some responses suggested that a wider range of opinion be sought. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Such a document needs to be discussed and approved by more than just the Primates&rsquo; Meeting. Input from laity and non-episcopal clergy is required. An Anglican Congress, consisting of bishops, clergy, and laity would be a more appropriate context in which to draft a Covenant.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>A contradiction was noted in 118, 119 about the authority of the covenant.</p>
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;There are contradictions in the Report regarding the role of the Covenant. For example, in Para 118, we read that &ldquo;of itself . . . it would have no binding authority,&rdquo; yet in Para 119 churches are told that &ldquo;the solemn act of entering a Covenant carries the weight of an international obligation so that . . . [a] church could not proceed internally and unilaterally. Which is true?&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p>There was a recognition that we already have ways of consulting within the communion, and we have agreed statements such as the Lambeth Quadrilateral. There was opposition expressed about a perceived trend towards increased centralization. Is the proposed structure intended to foster consultation or to block decisions? </p>
  	
  	<h3>Themes</h3>
  	<ul>
      <li>It was clear from the responses that Canadian Anglicans want to discuss issues of <strong>homosexuality</strong>, and are anxious that their opinions be heard. Although the Windsor report does not address this issue directly, it is clear from the number of responses that more discussion needs to happen. Many different points of view were expressed, covering the broad range of opinion in the Canadian church. </li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>Another clear theme was issues of <strong>authority</strong> and how it is expressed. There was a strong emphasis on the authority and interpretation of scripture, again with views covering a broad spectrum of opinion. The discussion of the structures of the Communion also revolved around issues of authority and power.</li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>Many responses raised questions about the <strong>structures of the Communion</strong> and the way it operates. There were concerns that the Windsor Report assumes a level of interdependence and centralization that are well beyond our current practice. There are differences in canonical structures and governance across the Communion &ndash; for example, in the relative authority of primates, bishops, and synods to make decisions in the life of a province. Some responses felt that cultural differences and differences in the way Provinces make decisions were not considered.</li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>There is anxiety about the increasing <strong>centralization of authority</strong> in the proposed Council of Advice and the increased role of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The anxiety was expressed in both &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; and &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; responses. Who gives this authority, and how is it to be accountable? There is concern also about the increasing authority of the Primates&rsquo; Meeting and a fear that this might be at the expense of the Lambeth Conference and the Anglican Consultative Council. Some felt that we already have what we need for communion without adding more structures. There is concern that the voice of the laity is not well represented in the councils of the Church.</li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>There is concern that the life of the Communion will become bogged down in <strong>rules of procedure,</strong> rather than in expressing the bonds of affection in consultation, dialogue and face-to-face relationships. Will all decisions need to be brought to the Communion before a Province can act? The need to ensure that episcopal candidates are acceptable to other provinces (131) caused particular concern.</li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>There is a need to examine <strong>unity</strong> more closely. What does unity mean in terms of Trinitarian theology, an expression of diversity in unity? Is unity an over-riding value, to be sought at all costs? What is the place of mission and justice in our search for unity?</li>
  </ul>
  	<blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;God is understood in # 2 primarily in terms of unity; the oneness of God then becomes the primary orientation point for the organization of the community, where unity is given primacy. One might contrast this with an approach beginning with the Trinity, in which unity is defined not in terms of sameness, but in terms of reconciliation of diversity.&rdquo;</p>

    <ul style="margin-top: 0;">
      <li>There was a concern about the use of <strong>&ldquo;illness&rdquo; </strong>as a metaphor for the life of the Anglican Communion.</li>
    </ul>
  	<blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&ldquo;I regret the use of &ldquo;illness&rdquo; as a metaphor for the life of the Communion at present. This seems to me to prejudge the issue &ndash; people raising questions about inclusivity are seen as causing trouble for others. Is it not possible that our disagreements are a sign of health and growth?&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>On the other hand, there were comments which suggested that the current situation can be seen as a gift, giving us an opportunity to explore more deeply God&rsquo;s call to us as a Communion.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;This crisis ought to be viewed as a gift from God. It should not be feared. Rather, it should be embraced.&rdquo;</p>

    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;Christianity is meant to be a stretch, a huge one, taking us where we would rather not go, beyond our comfort-zone, beyond our own kind, beyond the like-minded. In fact, one sign of health in our community is that such debates can occur.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	<ul>
      <li>There is in the responses a strong <strong>pastoral cry</strong> from people on both sides of the homosexuality issue. Each side to some degree feels abandoned by the church.</li>
  </ul>
  	<blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;I am deeply saddened that our church has taken a step away from the clear biblical foundations of the Anglican tradition. It is apparent to the people that I serve that Bishops are not defending the faith or banishing false doctrine. Please rise to the occasion and take us back to where we should be.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  	
  	<blockquote>
      <p>There is a perception that the needs of gay and lesbian people are not being listened to.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">&ldquo;[The document] is pastoral towards persons whose consciences are bruised by the conflict but has little pastoral heart for gay and lesbian people.&rdquo;</p>
        <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I am very concerned that Windsor has shifted the focus in such a way that unity, seen as international hegemony, is being considered in a manner which makes gay and lesbian people expendable. . . . By all means let us work for unity, but let&rsquo;s do so by keeping gay and lesbian people openly at the table. Where were they in the Windsor process?&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>A number of responses asked the question why the issue of homosexuality is the one which seems to be driving us apart, when we have debated other equally divisive issues over the years.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>We sensed a deep pastoral need for <strong>listening, dialogue and pastoral care</strong>. People are searching for scriptural teaching and pastoral support. There is a concern particularly about the pastoral care of gays and lesbians in conservative dioceses and provinces. Previous <strong>Lambeth resolutions </strong>have called on bishops &ldquo;to end any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation&rdquo; (1998) and called each Province &ldquo;to reassess . . . because of our concern for human rights, its care for and attitude towards persons of homosexual orientation.&rdquo; (1988)</li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>Questions were raised about the <strong>reception of reports</strong> such as the Windsor Report. How do Primates and bishops engage their Provinces in receiving the recommendations of international Anglican documents and reports? To what extent have documents like the Virginia Report been considered by Provinces?</li>
  </ul>
  	
  	<ul>
      <li>There is a concern that much more attention was paid to decisions in New Westminster and New Hampshire than to the role of <strong>intervening Primates</strong>. There are a number of comments on the intervention of bishops in the life of other Provinces. This practice is certainly a major departure from Anglican tradition.</li>
  </ul>
  	<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
  	<p>With regard to the question of the <strong>breaking up of the Anglican Communion</strong>, most respondents hoped that the communion would be able to stay together. Continuing dialogue and study, a willingness to meet and to talk, a focus on mission and justice, were seen to be key to this process. A small number, at either end of the spectrum, saw the breakup of the Communion as a real possibility. Here is a sampling of comments.</p>
  	<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The sooner we learn to walk apart the better for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;Were Augustine alive today he would not, I think, approve the blessing of same sex unions, but his advice would be now as it was then &ndash; live with our differences in charity and God will sort it out in the eschaton.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We need to realize that this [the colonial] period has passed and that now the various churches of the Anglican Communion are evolving in ways which are appropriate to their particular cultures but which differ significantly from one another. In some cases provinces will continue to have close and comfortable ties with each other but in other cases there will be a relationship which may more closely resemble the ecumenical relationships which Anglicans enjoy with other Christian denominations. This loosening of our ties would be preferable to a tightly controlled centralization and would allow us to turn our time and resources to the mission of the Church rather than to arguing with each other over structures and legislation.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;We are encouraged by the call (145) for all parts of the Communion to engage in continuing biblical study and theological reflection around same gender relationships.&rdquo;</p>
      </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We need to learn to live with tension, rather than finding ways to avoid it. To express one&rsquo;s disagreement with another part of the Communion by voting with one&rsquo;s feet (or one&rsquo;s wallet) is sin. ECUSA and New Westminster are challenging us by their actions, and we need to live with that tension and engage in discussion, rather than waiting for some curia or individual to tell us what to do. At times, we need to be able to do things one way in one place and another way somewhere else and yet stay together in love and fellowship.&rdquo;</p>
  </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">&ldquo;It would be desirable if there could be a middle way &ndash; that individual communions could agree to disagree but still value their commonalities.&rdquo;</p>
