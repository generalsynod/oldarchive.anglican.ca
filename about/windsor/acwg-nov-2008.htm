                  <p style="margin-top:0;">The Council of General Synod of the  Anglican Church of Canada endorsed the following report, prepared by the  Anglican Communion Working Group, in November 2008.&nbsp; This report, together with the &lsquo;Preliminary Response&rsquo;  adopted by the Council in May 2008, constitute the response to the St. Andrew&rsquo;s  Draft from the Anglican Church of Canada.&nbsp;</p>
                  <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Anglican Communion  Working Group<br />
                  <strong>Report to the Council of General Synod</strong></h2>
<p>The Anglican Communion Working Group met at  Queen of the Apostles Retreat Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, on October 26th  and 27th, 2008.&nbsp; The  following were present for the meeting:</p>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">The Rt. Rev&rsquo;d George Bruce Faith Worship and  Ministry (Chair), the Rev&rsquo;d Maureen Crerar, Faith Worship and Ministry, Ms.  Caroline Chum, Partners in Mission and Ecojustice; the Ven. Peter Fenty,  Partners in Mission and Ecojustice, the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d James Cowan, House of  Bishops; the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d Colin Johnson, House of Bishops, the Rev&rsquo;d Dr. Stephen  Andrews, member of the Anglican Consultative Council; the Rt. Rev&rsquo;d Sue Moxley,  member of the Anglican Consultative Council; Ms. Suzanne Lawson, member of the  Anglican Consultative Council</p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The Rev&rsquo;d Canon Alyson Barnett-Cowan, Staff</p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">Regrets were received from the Ven. Iain  Luke, Faith Worship and Ministry, who sent written comments.</p>
                  <p><strong>PURPOSE</strong></p>
                  <p>The Anglican Communion Working Group met  to:</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                    <li>review &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; on bishops&rsquo; responses to the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft of  the Covenant for the Anglican Communion and to prepare a further response to  this draft for forwarding to the Covenant Design Group; and,<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>advise  the Council Of General Synod on an appropriate response to the questions posed  to the Provinces of the Anglican Communion by the Joint Standing Committee of  the Primates and the Anglican Consultative Council.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>Task A</strong></p>
                  <p>The Joint Standing committee of the  Primates and the ACC referred the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft for an Anglican Covenant to  Provinces for further comment and requested responses to the following  questions.</p>
                  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&nbsp;</p>
                  <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>Is the Province able to give an  &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; commitment to the Covenant process at this time (without  committing itself to the details of any text)?<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>Is it possible to give some  indication of any synodical process which would have to be undertaken in order  to adopt the Covenant in the fullness of time?<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li> In considering the St Andrew&rsquo;s  Draft for an Anglican Covenant, are there any elements which would need  extensive change in order to make the process of synodical adoption viable?</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>In response to question 1, the ACWG  recommends that the Council of General Synod respond in the affirmative.</p>
                  <p>In response to question 2, the ACWG has  asked the Chancellor of General Synod to advise the Council of General Synod on  the necessary synodical process required for approval.</p>
                  <p>In response to Question 3, the ACWG  commends the following comments on the St Andrews&rsquo;s Draft for an Anglican  Covenant as an appropriate response from the Anglican Church of Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
                  <p><strong>COMMENTS</strong></p>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">It continues to remain unclear whether the  purpose of the document has been adequately explained in the draft text. We  continue to believe that the inclusion of the &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; into the body of  the Covenant would go a long way to providing clarification. Nevertheless, as  it is currently presented the document seems to have two conflicting  purposes:&nbsp; one, which describes the  nature of the Communion and our commitment to it, and another, (found mainly in  the draft Appendix) which, delineates a process for resolving disputes where it  is suggested that one or more Provinces are deemed to have breached the spirit  of the document. The Lambeth Commentary  affirms a covenantal focus which is relational. The text of the Appendix to the  St. Andrew&rsquo;s Draft for an Anglican Covenant is unnecessarily antagonistic and  legalistic in tone, rather than relational, and opens a Pandora&rsquo;s box of  potential complaints. We are able to affirm the statement of the CDG in &ldquo;A  Lambeth Commentary&rdquo;, pages 7 and 8, that the language of the draft covenant  &ldquo;can sound &lsquo;juridical&rsquo;, and that &ldquo;the CDG will look again at the language used  in the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Draft in order to find an idiom which reflects more  adequately the relational intent of the Covenant.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;"><strong>AFFIRMATIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>We congratulate the Covenant Design Group  for their most recent efforts and believe that the text of the St Andrew&rsquo;s  Draft is a great improvement upon its predecessor. We are glad to note that  many of the concerns raised by the Anglican Church of Canada have been addressed  in whole or in part in the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft. As a result, we take heart from  the responsiveness of the Covenant design process, in particular the  responsiveness indicated in the document &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo;.</p>
                  <p>We note particularly the following areas:</p>
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>The  changes incorporated into the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft indicate a serious effort on  the part of the CDG to listen to the concerns expressed by the Provinces and  are indicative of a desire for conversation and dialogue which form  a&nbsp;valuable part of the listening process proposed by&nbsp;Lambeth 98. In  both the Communiqu&eacute; and the Commentary, there is clear recognition that this  will be a slow and careful process and we are especially heartened by the work  done by the CDG since the meeting of the Lambeth Conference.<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>We  believe that the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft has taken into account concerns expressed  about the role of the Primates Meeting. &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; confirms the  Canadian response to the Nassau Draft, and may indeed indicate the need for a  further reduction in the international role of Primates.<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>The  St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft provides a much clearer recognition of the role of laity and  of synodical decision-making processes in the dioceses and Provinces throughout  the Communion. Efforts have also been made to clarify understanding of autonomy  and interdependence, though this may be being nuanced in the document &ldquo;A  Lambeth Commentary.&rdquo; (Question 9, page 10.)<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li> Fears  expressed in some quarters that the Covenant could assume the form of a narrow  confessional document have been significantly allayed in this draft. The  intention of the CDG to include an amending formula to the covenant increases  the unlikelihood of the document becoming a narrow confessional document.<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>The  St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft makes a serious effort to address the central role of worship  and prayer as key in holding us together. While we affirm this, we note that  the central role for both the Communion, and Anglican identity of worship and  prayer, with emphasis on the Eucharist as the sacrament of unity in the body of  Christ, is given inadequate expression in the Lambeth Commentary and should be  enhanced in the Covenant document itself, not relegated to the Appendix alone. <br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>Almost  all Canadian responses expressed concern over the way &ldquo;formularies&rdquo; were  addressed in Nassau Draft. We believe that the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft has made great  strides in alleviating these concerns and we affirm the expressed intent of the  CDG in &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; to do even further work in this area.<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>The  St Michael Report (produced by the Canadian Primate&rsquo;s Theological Commission)  recognized that doctrinal developments occur over time. The St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft  appears now to contain a similar recognition and while &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo;  does not explicitly address this question, consideration to the inclusion of a  reflection on the development of doctrine is needed.<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li> We  are pleased to see an addition to the preamble which recognizes the diversity  to be found throughout the Communion.<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>                    We  are pleased to see the reworking of the sections dealing with the &ldquo;Instruments  of Communion&rdquo; as they are now placed in a more coherent and chronological  fashion and are particularly glad to see the redefinition of the role of the  Primates&rsquo; Meeting as a gathering representing representatives of the Provinces  and not as a quasi  &ldquo;curia&rdquo;<br />
                      <br />
                    </li>
                    <li>We  are also pleased that the CDG undertook redrafting of the paragraphs relating  to the use of, and interpretation of, scripture. The new draft is much clearer  particularly as it relates to the interpretation of scripture. We affirm the  direction of the CDG as contained in &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; in this area.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><strong>AREAS  OF LACK OF CLARITY</strong></p>
                  <p>There are still a number of areas where  greater clarity is required.&nbsp; &ldquo;A  Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; takes up an observation of our earlier report that there  needs to be clarity around terms that are commonly used in the Communion but  are perceived locally in very different ways.&nbsp; These differences in perception can be the source of some  difficulty when coming to agreement. To assist the CDG in their efforts we  offer the following understandings of those terms from a Canadian perspective,  as was requested.</p>
                  <p><strong>&nbsp;&lsquo;episcopally led and synodically governed&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>Canada was not established as a national  Province with the subsequent development of dioceses, but the other way  around.&nbsp; Our history mirrors civil  federal and provincial structures (established in the same time period).&nbsp; This means that our national Province  does not have the same degree of authority as some other national Provinces do in  their jurisdictions.&nbsp; Governance of  the episcopate occurs within the jurisdiction of the internal ecclesiastical  provinces (we have four) and not the national Province.&nbsp; This may be unique to Canada and rather  complicates the matter of jurisdiction and authority.&nbsp; Even here, we are aware that governance structures in  Canadian society are coming under close scrutiny and that the days of  autocratic leadership are largely over. Apart from the chairing of General  Synod and the executive oversight of the General Synod Office, the Primate has  no ordinary jurisdiction in any Canadian diocese.&nbsp; The Primate has no national authority apart from the power  of suasion.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&lsquo;the role of bishops&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">Indeed, the balance of power even for  diocesan bishops exists in their ability to foster a spirit of collegiality  amongst both clergy and lay people.&nbsp;  Anglicans in Canada do not share a deference for episcopal authority  that they once held or similar to that which is held in other parts of the  Communion, but rather respond to an articulation of the gospel that finds  resonance with the values and priorities of the people of the diocese.&nbsp; In Canada, bishops are elected by  diocesan clergy and laity and are not appointed.&nbsp; Their election must receive concurrence from the bishops of the  internal ecclesiastical provinces. Moreover, the Canadian House of Bishops has  no canonical status apart from General Synod, a meeting in which they represent  one of three orders; otherwise their role is only advisory.&nbsp; <strong><u></u></strong></p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;common mind&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>In our particular context this means &ldquo;a  range of acceptable positions&rdquo;.&nbsp;  These positions are not reached arbitrarily, but through consultation,  prayer and testing with clergy and laity.&nbsp;  Because of the need to engage the whole people of God in this  discernment, we are critical of the assumption that the Primates are uniquely  responsible for articulating a &lsquo;common mind&rsquo; for the Communion.</p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;common standards of faith&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>Again, this covers a range of practices  that fall within the broadest standards of belief as articulated by the Lambeth  Quadrilateral.</p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;relinquishment&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>There are differing  views of relinquishment even within the Canadian Province. If the Covenant is  primarily relational rather than juridical, then we do not see this as a  disciplinary act declared by one party about another. One perspective is to  define relinquishment as a knowing departure and a &lsquo;freely-willed decision&rsquo; to  opt out.</p>
                  <p>An alternative view  holds that there may be circumstances where relinquishment would have to be  seen as a secondary and indirect effect of some other decision. In the case of  the United Church of South India, for example, they did not intend to leave the  Anglican Communion, but that was seen by others as a necessary (though  temporary) consequence of their determination to deal in a new way with the  historic episcopate. A Province contemplating a step of similar magnitude might  well believe that their actions should not lead to any loosening of  relationships, but that decision is not solely up to the initiating Province.</p>
                  <p>The CDG comments in  the current document seem to suggest that the decision to maintain or  relinquish relationships will be up to the Provinces, severally, given that  there is no agreement on empowering a central body to make that decision, and  more importantly that the tenor of the Covenant needs to be relational through  and through. If a Province were to take a step which resulted in all or nearly  all the other Provinces curtailing their relationships, that would amount to  relinquishment from this perspective.</p>
                  <p align="left" style="text-align:left;">Relinquishment may need  to be understood not simply as a &quot;choice to walk apart&quot; made by one  party, but rather as a consequence of certain other potential choices that the  web of relationship, expressed in a covenant, is unable to bear. And this may be  so even when the Province making such a choice does not directly will or desire  the consequence; though it is given effect not by a regulatory body, but by the  responses of the other signatories, acting severally. The difference (and  distance) between these two views needs some further clarity and conversation  within the Communion.</p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;essential concerns&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>At one point in the recent history of the  Communion it was said that the only way to leave the Communion was to disavow  the Lambeth Quadrilateral.&nbsp; We have  some sympathy with this understanding of what is an essential feature of our  common life, but we also recognize that what the Church regards as &lsquo;essential&rsquo;  changes from generation to generation.&nbsp;  We are not sure how such definitions can be determined in our context  without reference to the Anglican formularies and broad engagement with the  Church.</p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;wide consultation&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>This is not a question so much of what  &lsquo;wide&rsquo; means, but what does &lsquo;consultation&rsquo; entail?&nbsp; Does this mean simply the sharing of information or does it  imply the reaching of some consensus before any action is taken?&nbsp; There is a third option demonstrated in  the process involved in the consultation and revision of the Covenant. This has  been beneficial since it is apparent that the results of consultation have  influenced the modification of the proposed Covenant. </p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;development of doctrine&rsquo;</strong></p>
                  <p>Faith is dynamic; common standards of faith  should always be provisional; the Spirit is at work continually transforming  us.&nbsp; But we do acknowledge that the  goal of our transformation is the unchanging Christ.&nbsp; We need to understand how discernment has happened in the  past where doctrinal development has occurred.&nbsp; What is held in common at all times, however, is the  conviction that this is a faithful development of the tradition; a development  &lsquo;for this time&rsquo; or &lsquo;for this body&rsquo; (not necessarily universal).</p>
                  <p><strong>&lsquo;prophetic voice&rsquo;</strong> (our addition to the list)</p>
                  <p>We note that this phrase, which is used in  a compelling way in many parts of the Church, can be claimed by parties that  hold apparently contradictory points of view.&nbsp; We do not deny that the Spirit is always urging us onwards  and that the gift of prophecy is an important charism, but we are also mindful  that there may be false prophets and prophecies.&nbsp; The question is how we distinguish between them.</p>
                  <p><strong>AREAS OF OUTSTANDING CONCERN</strong></p>
                  <p>The St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft (Section 2)  acknowledges the mission of the Anglican Communion as being part of the mission  of the Christian church as a whole; however, it remains unclear in the text  whether or how the Covenant will affect ongoing bilateral and communion wide  dialogue with the Lutheran, Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches nor does it  address in particular those churches with whom we are in full communion. For  example the ACC/ELCIC; the IFI; The Porvoo churches; the old Catholics and the  United Churches of India and Pakistan. In Canada we treasure our full communion  relationship with the ELCIC as well as the relationships we have with other  Christian denominations. This is true also for other Provinces of the  Communion.&nbsp; Thus any further  revision of the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft needs to take this into account.</p>
                  <p>We also note that there is no reference to  the impact of the Covenant in interfaith contexts especially in parts of the  world where Christians are in the minority.</p>
                  <p>We are pleased to note that the Covenant  Design Group in its next revision of the text will address the methodology for  amending the Covenant if and as it is required.&nbsp; However, if as is suggested in &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; (page  14), the Covenant addresses ways in which our present reality calls us to  intensify our relationships within the Body of Christ, then what it says will  be significant but not exhaustive for future generations. Thus the need for  amendment would likely only apply to the processes or procedures for  implementation which may change as a result of experience. This should reduce  the complexity of any task of amending </p>
                  <p>We continue to have great concerns around  the content and tone of the Appendix as it was originally proposed and are  pleased to note that the bishops at Lambeth affirm that same concern. The  suggestion by the CDG of deleting the appendix and replacing it with a new  Section 4 may be of some benefit although, we note, that in our own context if  the procedures for administering the Covenant were in an appendix, which seem  to be the suggested contents of section 4, they would be easier to amend. In  most Canadian dioceses regulations to Canons, for example, can be amended by a  Diocesan Executive Council or similar body, without requiring a full Synod to  approve.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p>We can support the suggestions for topics  to be included in section 4 but we have great reservations about the hurried  timeline that will be given for review of the revised St Andrews Draft as a final  version of the Covenant text, particularly if the ACC meeting is to consider  approving the text for distribution to Provinces to begin their approval  process. It must be understood that in some Provinces the synodical decision  making processes are different from others and providing a revised St Andrew&rsquo;s  Draft barely weeks prior to the ACC meeting in May 2009 will not provide  sufficient time for consultation and advice.&nbsp; Finally, we suggest that if the procedures were included in  an Appendix it could be designated as a working document, for a period of  perhaps a decade and then reviewed as to its effectiveness.</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;As noted earlier, we continue to believe that the  Introduction to the St Andrew&rsquo;s Draft must be an integral part of the Covenant  document and find the argument contained in &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo; for not  doing so to be unconvincing. We concur with the CDG in that the Covenant needs  to be grounded in theological understandings of covenant and find the  conclusion that the Introduction does not carry the weight of the remainder of  the document to be baffling.</p>
                  <p>With respect to the proposed Anglican  Communion Covenant Commission, we have many questions. What is its composition?  What would its duties be? What does &ldquo;administering the Covenant&rdquo; mean? What is  the relationship with the Pastoral Forum proposed at Lambeth and the Council of  Advice suggested by the Windsor Report? Where do the funds for this body come  from? And finally, why do we need it?&nbsp;  It seems to us that the task of administering the Covenant would fit  well within the Anglican Consultative Council and its bodies.</p>
                  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">We are appreciative of the open and  transparent functioning of the CDG and have trust that comments from Provinces  are being heard. We, along with the Bishops as noted in &ldquo;A Lambeth Commentary&rdquo;,  are satisfied that sections 1, 2 and most of section 3 are satisfactory to the  Anglican church of Canada. We acknowledge that some minor amendment to those  sections may be required to provide greater clarity, but would have great  concern if these sections underwent any significant amendment.&nbsp; We would have great concern if the existing  Appendix or proposed section 4 did not undergo substantial amendment and with a  significant period of consultation.</p>
