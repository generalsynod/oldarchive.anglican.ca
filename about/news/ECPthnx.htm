                  <p><strong>A Statement from the ECP Thanksgiving Gathering held at the Mission, Cathedral Heights, Quezon City, Philippines on 4 and 5 March 2008</strong><br />
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                    The Episcopal Church in the Philippines was born in an occupied country, tried by tribulation and nurtured in communities of faith.  Now it is an autonomous church in the nation, challenged by its own vision to be &ldquo;a dynamic and vibrant church of caring, witnessing and mission-oriented parishes.&rdquo;  On March 4 &ndash; 5, 2008, the leadership of the Episcopal Church in the Philippines called together representatives of its overseas partners for a Roundtable Thanksgiving Gathering at the ECP Mission Center, Cathedral Heights, Quezon City to celebrate in festive and thoughtful ways the path to autonomy and the path forward for both the Episcopal Church in the Philippines and its accompanying partners.</p>
                  <p>The celebration of financial autonomy from the Protestant Episcopal Church in the USA, now known as The Episcopal Church (TEC), was the occasion for a wider reflection on the history and witness of the ECP as it moved towards a capacity for self-support, and self-reliance, and an occasion to celebrate the many partnerships that exist between the ECP and its overseas partners.The celebration also included an evening of music, prayer and dance.</p>
                  <p>In the desire to continue this &ldquo;walking together&rdquo; in pursuance of God&rsquo;s mission, workshops were undertaken to attempt to chart new road maps of cooperation.  On the whole, the workshops identified areas for continuing to build bridges of understanding and involvement, not only as partners with the ECP but as partners altogether.  People-to-people exchange was highlighted, especially for young people as an educational tool.  The affirmation of lay ministry and enhancing processes for joint monitoring and evaluation were encouraged.  Joint advocacy work on issues mutually relevant needs to be developed.  The ECP was challenged to improve its communications with its partners thru the website, thru emailing and thru other media whereby it may share its stories and experiences. </p>
                  <p>Overseas partners and ECP leadership were challenged to integrate the ECP Vision 2018 and ongoing partnerships in ways that further God&rsquo;s mission.  One incarnation of this challenge was a financial offering from the Episcopal Church Women of the ECP, through the <em>Pasasalamat</em> offering of the ECP, to the United Thank Offering (UTO) of TEC.  This offering, the first of an annual pledge, becomes a way to channel the missionary concerns of the ECP.</p>
                  <p>The workshop challenged the ECP and the Partners to be willing to give up old ways of relating so that the five marks of mission might be better inscribed in the hearts of all as they accompany one another in God&rsquo;s mission.  Marking the end of a phase in the ECP&rsquo;s life, this celebration is the beginning of something new, for as always Christ Jesus goes before and says, &ldquo;Behold I make all things new.&rdquo;</p>
