                  Leaders of different faith groups - Orissa, India </p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">At the  culmination of the protest and prayer rally of the Christians of Delhi and  National Capital region, thousands of people gathered in front of the Orissa  Bhavan to express solidarity with their brothers and sisters in the State of  Orissa. Nearly 50,000 schools run by the Christians all over the country were  declared closed today in protest of what is happening in Orissa.  Representatives from the Church of North India participated in full strength. As a token  of our support and solidarity with the victims of the violence all the CNI  educational institutions were closed on August 29, 2008 and everyone joined in  the dharna.</p>
                  <p>A memorandum to this effect was submitted  to the Governor of Orissa. The memorandum called upon the Governor to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Write to the President of India to  impose President&rsquo;s Rule in Orissa and that to take over the reigns of  governance so that peace is restored in Kandhamal and other districts. </li>
                    <li>Immediately suspend not constables and  junior officials but the Chief Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Director  General of Police for gross dereliction of duty, and for joining the conspiracy  to wipe out Christians in Orissa.</li>
                    <li>Hand over the Kandhmal district in  particular to the Indian army which alone can restore the confidence of the  victims.</li>
                    <li>Trace the many people reported  abducted, some feared dead or injured, in the last six days.</li>
                    <li>Bring back the tens of thousands of  Christian tribals and dalit villagers hiding for their lives in the forests,  most of them without food and adequate drinking water.</li>
                    <li>Hand over all investigations relating  to the circumstances and course of violence of the Central Bureau of  Investigations. The CBI should also investigate the murder of VHP leader Lakhsmananda  Saraswati.</li>
                    <li>Expand the terms of reference of the  sitting Judicial Commission handed by Mr. Justice Basudeo Panigrahi to fix  responsibility and culpability on government servants all ranks, as also on  guilty politicians.</li>
                    <li>Grant exemplary compensation to the  injured. Grant immediate relief and rehabilitation to the victims so that they  can rebuild their home, get back their jobs and resume norm human lives.</li>
                    <li>Compensate the church to rebuild and  restore its religious, education and humanitarian institutions.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Set up a Fast Track criminal court to  try those found guilty at all levels during all phases of the violence.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong><em>The Rev. Dr. Enos Das Pradhan, General Secretary, The  Synod of the Church of North India, had through a press release called upon the  Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Chief Minister, Orrisa, to rise to  the occasion.&nbsp; He had expressed his  anguish and pain at what the Christians had to go through for no fault of them.</em></strong></p>

                  <p style="margin-top:0;">Responding to the press release by the Rev.  Dr. Enos Das Pradhan, the Archbishop of Canterbury and all the other Partners  expressed support and prayer at this crucial time. The Council for World  Mission South Asia Regional Council in its meeting held at Khulna, Bangladesh,  from August 27-31, 2008 condemned the attacks on the Christian.&nbsp; CWM SARC is a council comprising of the  Church of North India, Church of South India, Presbyterian Church of India and  the Church of Bangladesh.</p>

Das met Mr. Mohammed  Shafi Qureshi, Chairperson, National Commission for Minorities and filed a  petition seeking intervention.&nbsp; Mr.  Qureshi and his team patiently heard the happenings and assured that he would  seek additional forces to be deployed and immediate relief to be given to the  effected people.&nbsp; He further said that a  team from NCM will be sent within a week.&nbsp;  Mr. Qureshi further called upon that there should be a ban on entry of  people like Mr. Praveen Togadia. An all party delegation to the effected area  should be initiated at the centre is another demand that the NCM proposed.</p>
                  <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Later a delegation comprising of Bishop  Samson Das, Ms. Sushma Ramswai, and representatives from the CBC met the Prime  Minister, Shri Man Mohan Singhji.&nbsp; The  Prime Minister was anguished to know about the situation. He said, it&rsquo;s a  national shame what is happening in Orissa. He categorically said that the  Chief Minister and the Governor have failed to do their duties.&nbsp; Later the Prime Minister called the Chief  Minister of Orrisa Mr. Naveen Patnaik and said that he should see that normalcy  is restored immediately. The Prime Minister also assured that money from the  Prime Minister fund would be released for rehabilitation of the sufferers.</p>
