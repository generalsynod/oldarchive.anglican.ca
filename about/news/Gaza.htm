                  <p>The Right Hon. Stephen Harper<br />
                    Prime Minister of Canada<br />
                    House of Commons,<br />
                  Ottawa, ON</p>
                  <p><strong>RE: KAIROS Calls for Canada to Act re the Siege of Gaza</strong></p>
                  <p> <br />
                    Dear Prime Minister Harper:</p>
                  <p>KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives, which undertakes justice work for eleven churches and church-related organizations, expresses our deep concern for the suffering of the civilian population in Gaza.  KAIROS partner organizations in Gaza are informing us of the catastrophic consequences of the Israeli siege, and urgently appeal for its immediate end.</p>
                  <p>We urge you, Prime Minister, to issue a statement immediately condemning the siege and calling for the restoration of essential humanitarian aid, including supplies of fuel.  It is also vital that Israel be pressed to reopen the borders of Gaza for trade - so that people can work and supply their own needs.</p>
                  <p>KAIROS condemns the rocket attacks on Israeli towns from Gaza. All attacks on civilians are a violation of international law.  We join Palestinian and Israeli partners in stating that Palestinian fighters must stop targeting civilians in Israeli towns.</p>
                  <p>We also echo the voices of Palestinian and Israeli partners who say that these attacks in no way justify this siege, which severely harms 1.5 million men, women and children. Israel is obligated, as an occupying power, to ensure the safety and welfare of civilians living in the occupied territories. The Israeli government&rsquo;s declaring Gaza a &ldquo;hostile entity&rdquo; does not allow it to ignore its obligations to the territory.</p>
                  <p>Canada has been notably silent on this crisis.  Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to which Canada is a signatory, collective punishment is a war crime. Article 33 states: &quot;<em>No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed,</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.</em>&quot;  Canada has an obligation to speak out against this collective punishment of the people in Gaza.</p>
                  <p>KAIROS is further disturbed that Canada voted against a United Nations resolution at the Special Sixth Session of the U. N. Human Rights Council, which condemned the Israeli human rights violations in Gaza. Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier has recently visited the region and must surely be aware of the devastating impact on civilians of Israel&rsquo;s siege in the context of its long occupation of Palestinian territories.</p>
                  <p>The closure of the border crossings from Israel into Gaza is causing severe shortages of food and medical supplies. Due to Israel&rsquo;s embargo of electricity and fuel supplies, Gaza&rsquo;s power plant has had to shut down. There is no electricity or fuel for hospitals, ambulances, or to pump water.  On January 22, one shipment of fuel was allowed in, enough for only one week. </p>
                  <p>The church based Department of Services to Palestinian Refugees stated on January 21st: &ldquo;All Palestinians in Gaza are paying a very heavy price indeed. Scores have been killed and others seriouslyinjured by Israeli military strikes. As the border crossing points remain closed, there are tragic stories ofchronically ill patients dying as theyawait permission to cross. The latest is a 14-year old boy who died of cancer on Sunday, January 20th.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>We affirm the conviction of Israeli and Palestinian partners in the region that the long-standing issues between Israelis and Palestinians cannot be resolved militarily. The ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, in violation of international law, is a profound injustice blocking a lasting peace.</p>
                  <p>We therefore call on the Canadian government to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>request that the Israeli government and its army put an immediate end to the siege of Gaza<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>work with others in the international community to bring about a sustainable, negotiated resolution based on an end to the Israeli occupation, which forms the basis of the conflict.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We look forward to hearing what actions our government is taking on this issue.<br />
                      <br />
                    Sincerely,<br />
                    Cheryl Curtis,<br />
