                  <h2>African Women Economic Policy Network (AWEPON)                  </h2>
                  <p><strong>Appeal for Peace</strong><br />
                    <strong><img src="images/clip_image002_000.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="173" align="right" /></strong>We can just imagine those sweet smiles that lit up the whole country shortly before the end of 2007. We are truly sorry about the post election violence in a country that has been deemed as a model of African democracy.  Our anxiety is becoming more frequent as the number of refugees is soaring. Innocent women and children are redundant in poor camps in Uganda.<br />
                    <br />
                  This school where these Women have found temporary refuge has no bathing shelters and the local health centres around it have no drugs.</p>
                  <p> 
                    Moreover, all indications are that the unrest in western Kenya could force more refugees into Uganda and other neighbor countries following the failure of the current mediation efforts. We are praying for quick return of calm as we know that in this situation, vulnerable people especially Women are more of victims while politicians are up in arms for power. <em>-Elephants are fighting and the grass has suffered enough-.</em></p>
                  <p>But, as Christians, we should not take sides, despair and throw up our arms. If we withdraw, then we are being victims of circumstances and we will be blaming ourselves for the suffering people have endured since 30th December 2007.</p>
                  <p>Our courage is more needed than ever and we need to stand up for peace. In accepting our helplessness and opening to compassionate learning from this conflict, there will be an opportunity to evolve our souls and thank God for the privilege of life we still posses amidst honorific loss of our beloved sisters and brothers.</p>
                  <p>AWEPON wishes to call for a move into compassion. All Kenyans are one people and one nation of God, when love for all is observed, between and among citizenry including political opponents, we shall recognize that when our neighbors yell, they are feeling lonely and afraid and have no loving politicians at that moment to handle their suffering.</p>
                  <p>We need to keep reminded that the love of God and the support of a God who can hold us in his arms can only be gained by an experience of a living person, Jesus Christ, but not being instructed by political/authority figures.</p>
                  <p><strong>Our Humble Call for Peace</strong></p>
                  <p>Having learnt lessons from the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the current situation in Darfur region, AWEPON is willing to offer any available support towards peace building process and also call upon:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>World political leaders</strong> not to be indifferent spectators while horrid scenarios are repeated in Africa. Leaders need to make a fast move from current rhetoric about Kenya&rsquo;s situation to finding a quick and lasting solution.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>Media</strong> pleas for peace should harness and continue to thrive; we appreciate &quot;Save Our Beloved Country&quot; has been an appealing message.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>Donors</strong> should move in quickly and rescue stranded people/refugees. Support for peace building and reconciliation processes in the country is also urgently required. <br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>Leaders</strong>&rsquo; reckless statements must end now and pave way for reconciliation process. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
                  <p>&ldquo;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death. Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.&rdquo; 1 John 3:14-15:</p>
                  <p>&ldquo;If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.&rdquo; (Romans 12:18) </p>
                  <p>&lsquo;Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers a multitude of sins.&rsquo; (Proverbs 10)</p>
                  <p>&ldquo;Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.&rdquo; 11 Colossians 3:12-13:</p>
                  <p>                    With deep Concern from<br />
