                <p>Following recent  Presidential elections in Sri Lanka, the following statement &quot;Post  Presidential Election Realities&quot; was issued by Heads of Churches, including  Bishops Duleep de Chickera and Kumara Illangesinghe, Church of Ceylon. </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>The  (Anglican) Church of Ceylon, a long standing partner of the Anglican  Church of Canada, is a leader among faith communities in Sri Lanka, seeking  reconciliation and peace with justice in a country battered by many years of  civil war. Though the end of this war in 2009 by military means brought a  cessation of hostilities, much political work is now needed to  ease peoples' suffering and bring about hope, especially among those who  continue to be internally displaced in the north and east. Please pray  for the church in Sri Lanka, and its leaders, for all communities of faith and  those seeking the re-establishment of the rule of law, order and good  government. &lt;&lt; <strong><a href="SLpostelection.htm">Read the full statement </a></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
