                <p> </p>
                <p><img src="images/afterSundayworship-AnglicanDinkacongregation-Juba.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="225" align="right" />We, the church and community leaders participating in the ECS Justice, Peace and Reconciliation Conference on behalf of the 24 dioceses of ECS, meeting in Juba, Southern Sudan, on 14th-17th January 2008 under the theme <em><strong>Blessed are the Peacemakers for they shall be called the Children of God,</strong></em> have spent four days in very valuable discussion, listening and in dialogue with one another, to assess the current situation in our places and plan how the Church can respond in co-operation with our communities and government.  We affirm our Christian calling to work for peace, recognizing our Gospel mandate to take the lead to bring peace, and in thanksgiving to God who has reconciled us to himself through the death of his Son, Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace.  We seek to work according to the grace of God and in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                <p>In particular, we make the following recommendations:</p>
                <p><strong>Tribalism</strong><br />
                  We see an urgent need to address the issue of tribalism, within the church, and in all our communities.  We see this as part of the wider question of how do we see ourselves as Sudanese people?  This issue underlies many of the problems we face in Sudan.  Can we recognize each other as created in the image of God, and as part of a single humanity blessed by God in order to fill the earth?  We applaud the great progress made in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement [CPA] but see that we still experience many divisions along ethnic lines, according to colour, according to tribe or through the absence of respect for our own languages.  We consider it our urgent priority to proclaim the Gospel message of love, and of mutual respect for one another as created in God&rsquo;s image and equal before God.  We affirm our &lsquo;unity in diversity&rsquo;.</p>
                <p>We recommend specific measures to address tribalism, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Education to overcome prejudice and promote awareness of the dangers of tribalism;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Develop a school curriculum which introduces our different cultures;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Transfer church personnel between areas and regions;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Establish boarding schools and ensure transfer of teachers between areas;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Encourage reconciliation and forgiveness at all levels, from top to grass roots;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Leading by example in avoiding rough words about other groups.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Comprehensive Peace Agreement</strong><br />
                  The CPA provides the basis for a just and sustainable peace in Sudan.   We give thanks to God for the Agreement and express our support for all efforts to ensure its full and timely implementation.  We nevertheless recognize that many people within our communities remain ignorant about the content of the CPA and see an urgent need for its widespread dissemination.  We therefore recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>use of preaching opportunities, public occasions and the mass media to disseminate information on the CPA;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>organizing workshops, seminars and rallies, including the involvement of sister churches;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>the involvement of church leaders, Mothers&rsquo; Union, Youth and Community leaders in propagating the CPA;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>co-operation with UNMIS in organizing CPA awareness programmes;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>networking and partnership with NGOs, including use of their materials to promote the CPA, and translation of CPA into local languages;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>appoint a CPA Sunday in churches, and CPA Monday in secondary schools.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Referendum</strong><br />
                  We recognize the Referendum to be held in 2011 as being of key significance in the implementation of the CPA.  Aware of the various aspirations of our communities, we consider it important for Church leaders to speak with a united voice on this issue.  We affirm the right of every human being to decide his or her destiny, and accordingly we support the right of self determination for the people of Southern Sudan to decide their future, whether for unity or separation.  We commit ourselves to raise awareness of the Referendum to ensure that the process is carried out with proper transparency, and propose that the Church and community leaders be involved in ensuring such transparency.</p>
                <p><strong>Safeguarding the Church&rsquo;s position in Northern Sudan</strong><br />
                  While there may be uncertainty regarding the future political arrangements, we affirm that the Church has no boundaries.  We commit ourselves to the unity of the Church of Sudan whether across one or two countries.  To consolidate the Church&rsquo;s position in Northern Sudan we propose the following strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Training of clergy and church leadership in economics and financial management;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Capacity building of indigenous Christians to take positions in the Church;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Advocacy and mobilisation of Church and political forces together to repeal laws which restrict access to land for the building of churches, and restrict the Church&rsquo;s activities;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Promoting constructive dialogue between Christians and Muslims at all levels and in all parts of Sudan;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Working together with other churches to ensure equal representation of Christians and Muslims within the Ministry of Religious Affairs in the Government of National Unity;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Establish missionary dioceses in the North to encourage the exchange of experiences between the South and North as well as with other parts of the world;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>To launch missionary programmes involving the South to enable experienced clergy to serve for at least two years in the North.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Addressing Trauma and Threats of Revenge</strong><br />
                We recognize as a serious threat to security and well-being the war&rsquo;s widespread legacy of trauma and the desire for revenge.  To address this we propose:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The training of counsellors;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>The development of a Bible-based curriculum for counsellors;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Encourage a holistic approach to healing which includes emotional and spiritual healing as well as education, reparation, the rule of law and respect for humanity;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Teaching and Practice of Forgiveness;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Truth and Reconciliation Commission.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disarmament</strong><br />
                  The proliferation of small arms represents a serious danger within our communities.  We recommend close co-operation between the Church, the Government and Community Leaders in addressing this, in particular by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Supporting the work of the SDDR and SSDDR;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Addressing the root causes of people&rsquo;s refusal to disarm;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Ensuring that security is maintained for all people;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Creating awareness of the danger of arms within the community;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Encouraging compensation and providing development funds to whole communities;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Controlling the sale of arms.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Armed Forces</strong><br />
                  We have identified an important responsibility of the Church towards the dignity and well-being of our armed forces.  We recognize the effect which many years of conflict have on those bearing arms.  We therefore recommend renewed efforts by the Church:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> to provide army chaplains and assist in their training;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>to organize workshops for army officers and co-operate in providing civic education;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>to encourage the army and police in maintaining law and order;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>To enlighten the community to recognize and care for the army as our own children.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Issues of cattle keeping and farming</strong><br />
                  We have been concerned at reports of local conflicts between cattle keepers and farming communities.  Memories of peaceful co-existence in earlier times assure us that such conflict can be avoided.  We propose committed efforts to make it possible for both groups to pursue their livelihoods without damaging each other&rsquo;s interests.   In particular we recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the location of cattle well away from agricultural lands;<br />
                    enlightenment of cattle owners in the care of their cattle and the damage caused to crops;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>the forming of joint committees comprising of cattle owners and farmers to solve their problems;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>lobbying the local authority to introduce appropriate laws and regulations for cattle owners and agricultural schemes;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>fines where owners allow their cattle to destroy crops;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>encouraging cattle owners to return to their original places.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Returnees</strong><br />
                  Recognizing the difficulties faced by communities in the re-integration of returnees with different cultures, whether from Khartoum, East Africa or overseas, we propose that the Church co-operate closely with local government in welcoming returnees and assisting in their re-integration.  In particular we recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>To organize jointly a warm welcome for returnees;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Encouraging the roIe of families in facilitating re-integration;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Encouraging co-operation between Ministries for Youth &amp; Sport, Gender and </li>
                  <li>Education in organizing programmes;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Development of community facilities to provide social and spiritual space for re-integration to take place, such as a multi-purpose centre.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Displacement by oil exploration and other commercial interests</strong><br />
                  We are concerned at the absence of consideration for those displaced from their land by oil exploration and other commercial interests.  We recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Proper regulation of the activities of commercial interests, including strict environmental controls;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Advocacy by the Church on behalf of those displaced for compensation, proper resettlement, and training and employment opportunities.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Unity of the Church</strong><br />
                  We recognize a specific responsibility to work for the unity of the Church and see a special urgency for joint working where churches risk being identified locally along tribal lines.   In particular we recommend:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Holding a united day of thanksgiving and prayer for peace;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Ecumenical prayers at grass-roots level;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Respect for each other&rsquo;s faith and processes;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Avoiding naming churches on a tribal basis;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Networking with other denominations in sharing workshops and conferences;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Active support for the Sudan Council of Churches;<br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Re-enforcing ECS Episcopal Order No.1 at every level of ECS.<br />
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
                  Having heard at first hand of the situations in different parts of Sudan, and in particular of the continuing suffering in Darfur, we hold the concerns of all our people in our hearts and commit ourselves before God to prayer and action on their behalf.  We plan to take forward these recommendations through the ECS Justice Peace and Reconciliation Commission, through visits to conflict areas by members of the Commission, and through the activities of our dioceses, in particular the diocesan Justice, Peace and Reconciliation Committees.    We will work in close co-operation with community leaders, the Government, the UN Mission and other stakeholders to build peace, justice and reconciliation in our land.  May Almighty God support us in this work.</p>
