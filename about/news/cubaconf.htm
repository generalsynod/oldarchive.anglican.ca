                  <p>Dear Brothers and  Sisters of the Cuban churches: </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Greetings  of peace and joy in our Lord, Jesus Christ. </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>We, the  representatives of churches and ecumenical organizations from 19 Latin American  and Caribbean countries, invited by the Cuban Council of Churches (CIC), the  Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Centre, the Latin American Council of Churches  (CLAI), the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Evangelical Theological  Seminary (SET) are meeting here, in Matanzas, Cuba, from 22 to 26 June, in  order to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Havana Hispano-American  Evangelical Congress (1929). We have arrived in Cuba at a historical moment  when the unfair blockade imposed by the Government of the United States against  the Cuban revolution and the Cuban people remains and the situation  deteriorates with the global economic crises. Furthermore, to this has been  added, in recent years, the imprisonment of our five Cuban brothers, who have  been deprived of the most elemental human rights, suffering from unfair  treatment and cruelty against their personal integrity, as well as ignoring the  judicial procedures contemplated by international law and the Constitution of  the United States itself.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>We admire these  courageous people who, with integrity and determination, seek to defend the  achievements reached through the Cuban revolution in the fields of education,  health, culture and standard of living, among others. We are grateful for the  solidarity that Cuba has shown consistently with the countries of Latin America  and the Caribbean, and other regions of the world, through sending doctors to  humanitarian missions and other disasters caused by natural phenomena, as well  as offering free education to Medicine students and sharing the programme  called &ldquo;Yes, I can&rdquo; in order to eradicate illiteracy in several countries.&nbsp; </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p class="photoright"><img src="images/statueisofJoseMarti-matanzas.JPG" width="184" height="250" hspace="6" vspace="6" /><br />
                  Statue to Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;, Matanzas Central Park </p>
                  <p>We have brought, from  our own contexts, the heavy burden of neoliberal politics, which exclude and  marginalize the majority of our population. Although democracy has gained  ground, the system is still not responding to the needs of the less favoured  social classes &ndash; especially the indigenous peoples, the afro-descendant  cultures, women, children, youth, people with disabilities and the elderly  population &ndash; and it continues practicing economic exploitation, violence and  destruction of their culture. This injustice prevents peace based on economic  justice and full human development in most of the continent. Living the mission  in this context is breaking the wall of indifference and developing solidarity  together. The faces of these historical individuals are evangelizing us and  make the face of God visible, because&hellip;&rdquo;The truth reveals itself more clearly to  the poor and to those who suffer&rdquo; (Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;).</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>There are other  challenges threatening our people. An economic system that, through violence, causes  the destruction of the Earth and makes the whole  creation groan as in the pains of childbirth (Romans 8:22).</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The European and  North American churches, with which we have a relationship that we express and  live in our mutual partnership in mission, have joined their efforts to those the  Latin American and Caribbean churches. With these churches, we continue trying  to raise awareness among the European, North American and Canadian governments,  so that they start meaningful changes in their power structures. The purpose is  to achieve greater equity, balance and fair treatment in trade, economic,  financial and market-pricing relations. The external debt, an unfair burden for  our people, is a reflect of the unfairness of the current international  financial system. In many occasions, this cause acquires a prophetic dimension  which is also aimed at denouncing the corruption and complicity of these unfair  practices, favoured and concealed by the governments of our countries. </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>These  are times of turbulence and confusion: critical times</strong></p>
                  <p>There are religious  movements that impose themselves from the imperial power centres, exporting  oppressive and manipulative religious domination models. They are presented in  a tempting way and they are idols intended to replace the true God. Some of its  manifestations are the theology of prosperity, the theology of spiritual war,  the apostolic networks with their hierarchies and authoritarianism, which confuse  the concept of ministry while promoting schemes and codes of conduct for economic  power, privileges and distortion of the true meaning of the evangelizing power  as service in the kingdom of God. (Mark, 10:35-45).</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p><strong>These  are times of reaffirmation and hope</strong></p>
                  <p>We reaffirm our  commitment with the constant search of our own protestant, Caribbean and Latin  American identity within the daily reality of our people. With humility, we  take up God&rsquo;s challenge to get involved in the struggle for God&rsquo;s kingdom in  the midst of the conflicts of history. The unity in diversity that we wish to  promote is in itself an announcement of the kingdom by the Grace of God. We  must bear witness of this unity, overcoming the barriers of hatred, prejudice  and all forms of oppression for the accomplishment of the holistic mission of  the church (Isaiah 58:2 &ndash; 8, Mathew 25:31-46)</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>There are cumulative  experiences of resistance, from a spirituality that embraces and emphasizes the  true values of the kingdom of God (Galatians 5:22 &ndash; 25). The evangelization becomes  an announcement, a testimony and a liberating practice that heals, restores,  reconciles and transforms life. These values invigorate hope. We are certain  that, in spite of it all, the Spirit is calling us for life, It gives us the  strength to participate actively in the new things that God is creating in  history (Romans 8:26-27). It is our opportunity to become the collaborators of  God in what God is blessing. As the song written by Bishop Federico Pagura  says: </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>So we today have hope and expectation. </p>
                  <p>So we today can struggle with conviction. </p>
                  <p>So we today can trust  we have a future,</p>
                  <p>so we have hope.</p>
                  <p></p>

                  <p>During the opening  liturgical ceremony of this commemoration, a group of elderly women of the  Project &lsquo;Weavers of Hope&rdquo; of the Evangelical Theological Seminary (SET), gave  each participant of the event small butterflies woven in different colours as a  gift. We take this gift with us with the promise to continue praying for the  Cuban people and churches, so that this hope becomes a reality in this society  which is becoming increasingly fair and which, as every other society, can be  improved. We promise to continue invigorating hope in our daily struggle. </p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Jos&eacute; Mart&iacute;, the apostle  of Cuba and all America, emphasized with righteous conviction &ldquo;It is the time  of mobilization, of marching together, and we must go forward in close ranks,  like silver in the roots of the Andes.&quot;</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>With our dreams and  hopes, we will continue walking with faith, knowing that the Resurrected Christ  is walking ahead of us.</p>
