A NEW ACADEMIC YEAR 2008-2009 AT SET</strong></p><p>
Students from different denominations went into SET to start their studies of the program of in the program Bachelor of Theology. We could verify through their reflections what means to be a student at the seminary, what joins them, how much they have in common as regards their expectative and the theologian training they will have.</p><p>

Avila from the Brothers &ldquo;Quakers&rdquo;. According to their opinions, they hope to get the necessary tools and knowledge to serve the community as pastors or laypersons. They feel they have been very kindly welcomed. They stated that the SET is a school for the life and that they wish to live in community &ndash;in spite their differences- as in a new house full of peace and unity.</p><p>
They also said that two students have already clearly defined their vocations: one of them want to develop a work with disabled people and the other one wants to develop the music within the Christian Education.</p><p>
In general, this first-year group shows themselves eager of knowledge and they hope &ndash;the all the long of their career to find response to their biblical and theological questions.</p><hr /><p><strong>

&ldquo;A really significant and touching moment was the celebration of the 62nd anniversary of the foundation of the SET on 1st October. The activities stated in the chapel Resurrection where it was remembered the marking date together with some foreign guests, civil authorities and faculties and students of the SET. Next, the presents went to the old country house where with a historical and cultural act having the performance of the group of dance Espiral from Matanzas. It was remembered the three more important moments of the history of the house: the colony and slavery moment, the late 19th century and moment of the foundation of the Seminary up to this moment when with the help and resources of congregations and missions faithful to the Seminary, they achieved to turn this house into a living history this old house, a history come to life again.</p><p>

MAKING SISTER THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF THE US</strong></p><p>
22 to 25 September, a meeting for making sisters the Reformed-Presbyterian church of Cuba and the Presbyterian church of US took place at SET.</p><p>
&lsquo;This kind of happening takes place every time both parts have the need to check the relationships base and to further a suitable comprehension of them and to design strategies for the future as well &ndash;said to Acontecer the presbyter Daniel Izquierdo Hernandez, Moderator of the Reformed-Presbyterian Church of Cuba, Chairperson of the Board of Management of the SET and organizer of this event. This is the fifth meeting in Cuba, others have been held in US but without a Cuban representation or with few delegates.</p><p>
&ldquo;This meeting has been one with a bigger participation, due to the increasing of making brothers and sisters. 27y American delegates and 32 Cuban ones attended the meeting representing a wide raging spectrum of the relationships among the Synod, presbyters, congregations and the seminary&rdquo;, he added.</p><p>
To celebrate it, we chose this place because of all its facilities and logistic offered by this institution and for its naturals surrounding and, also, because the seminary has kept brotherhood with some of these American Congregations&rdquo;.</p><hr /><p><strong>
TWO CELEBRATION DAYS AT THE LIBRARY OF THE SET: PRESENTATIONS OF BOOKS</strong></p><p>
On two consecutive days filled up with joy because of the presentation of two books written by professors of the SET. On the first day, was showed the book &ldquo;Bajo la Accion de Su Palabra, Reflexiones en Tiempo de Participaci&oacute;n Comprometida to de Dogmatica&rdquo; (Under the Action of His Word, some reflections in times of engaged participation) by Master Carlos Camps Cruell graduated of Bachelor of Theology in this Seminary and the mastery in the Seminary of Theology of Princeton, US. He also graduated of Bachelor of Arts at the University of Havana. Since 1984, he works as a professor at the chair of Systematic Theology in this institution.</p><p>
His book deals with a wide range of issues which gives theological responses within the actual Cuban context from the past to the present. It was presented by Pablo Oden Marichal Rodriguez, vice-director of the SET.</p><p>
The second book was &ldquo;Praxis Teol&oacute;gica, una introducci&oacute;n a la Dogm&aacute;tica&rdquo;(Theological Praxis, an introduction to Dogmatic) by professor Adolfo Ham, Doctor of Theology of the united Seminary of Canada. He also made a Doctorate of Philosophy at the University of Santiago de Cuba. Since 1965, he has in charge the teaching of Philosophy at the Chair of Philosophy and History on this Seminary.</p><p>
His work collects all his notes for an introduction course to Theology taught at the Superior Institute of Biblical-Theological Studies (ISEBIT), enriched with a dialogue with the students. It is a very important tool for the teaching of this subject. It was presented by Rainerio Arce Valentin.</p><p>
The two books written by our professors left deep traces in all the people present at the two presentations who also enjoyed both pleasant speeches by their authors and the dialogue with the audience.</p><p>
Each day, there was a display of all the books by both professors which are in the collection of our library.</p><hr /><p><strong>
A LITERARY TEA PARTY AT THE LIBRARY OF THE SET</strong></p><p>
This tea party &ndash;organized by the students of the SET and coordinated by the first-year students Yamilka Gonzalez- started with a nice soir&eacute;e dedicated to the Cuba poetess Dulce Maria Loynaz, Cervantes Prize of Literature. The evening was full of anecdotes, short poems were said. The presentation was made by Maestro Rene Castellanos and Candido Fernandez. This activity made to know to those present more about the exceptional woman who surrendered to God to her death.</p><hr /><p><strong>
OUTREACH FOUNDATION FROM THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH VISITS THE SET</strong></p><p>
Representatives from the Presbyterian Church of Peachtree, Atlanta and the Outreach Foundation visited the Set from 29 September to 2 October. This organization keeps brotherhoods with the SET and the Reformed-Presbyterian Church of Cuba. Together with us, they enjoyed the activities for the 62 th anniversary of this institution,  founded in 1946.</p><p>
&ldquo;The Foundation has been helping the Seminary through different projects for eight years &ndash;explained to Acontecer Doctor of Theology Robert J. Weingartner, the Executive-Director of Outreach Foundation. We use to collect donations from the Presbyterian congregations in the US and also from some people from other denominations who wish to contribute in a personal manner. With this help, the Seminary has been able to achieve the enlargement of the library and the rebuilding of  the villa which was dedicated to this 62nd anniversary of the SET.</p><p>
I think this is a very important place &ndash;pointed out Weingartner- because here the leaders are prepared to accomplish a work at churches. Besides &ndash;he stated- I am much convinced that thanks to the theological training given here, this institution has formed excellent Cuban thinkers&rdquo;.</p><hr /><p><strong>
INTERSEMINARY MEETING IN MATANZAS</strong></p><p>
Reinerio Arce Valentin, Director of the Evangelical Seminary of Theology (SET), had the welcome speech at the opening devotional of the interseminary meeting. Directors of seminaries of Theology and equivalent institutions from Latin America, Canada and Cuba came to the meeting from 27 to 30 October. This meeting was good for the exchange of experiences and to deal with some common issues among the 35 participants.</p><p>
The first day of work, there was a lecture &ldquo;The world and the society where we work&rdquo; by the Cuban sociologist Aurelio Alonso, Director of the magazine Casa de las Americas. In the framework of the event, in the afternoon, the students of the SET met with the participants. There, they proposed the creation of a network or ecumenical association of students of Theology. This initiative was very well received by the assistants. In the evening, the quintet of classical music &ldquo;Opus&rdquo; of Matanzas performed a concert with a repertoire going from classical composer to more light international music, closing the night with some Cuban melodies.</p><p>
The second day, Doctor Ofelia Ortega Suarez &ndash;chairperson of the World Council of Churches (WCC), Vice-chairperson of the World Reformed Alliance and Professor of the SET- presented an approach the subject &ldquo;Biblical hints for the education today&rdquo;. In this paper, Dr.Ortega researched about those biblical paradigms which could help us in the supreme act of the theological thinking. In the afternoon, they discussed in panel         the subject &ldquo;Challenges of the theological education today&rdquo;, with the participation of Dr.Roberto Zwetsch from the Latin American and Caribbean Community of Theological and Ecumenical Education (CETELA), Jose Duque from the Latin American Biblical University of Costa Rica y WCC-ETE, Dorcas Gordon (Knox College, Canada), Sherron George (Presbyterian Church of US (PCUSA) and Adolfo Ham Reyes (SET, Cuba). That evening, they watched two documentaries about the social projects the SET develops to support the communities, with which the seminary does a diaconal work, coordinating or facilitating them. After, they enjoyed the concert performed by the ecumenical group &ldquo;Agua Viva&rdquo;of Matanzas.</p><p>
The discussions in plenary and the exchange of experience were very enriching moments &ndash;they called them: the moments to open windows- with the object to find solutions to a better insertion in the theological education, at churches and in the countries.</p><p>
In the next sessions, the seminaries and the faculties of Theology, the agencies of cooperation and the churches presented and discussed about the &ldquo;Challenges of the training and the study plans&rdquo;, &ldquo;Administrative, financial and structural challenges&rdquo;, an unanimous feeling expressed by the participants was the need to strengthen the network of the theological education, to make it be recognized and to count on the mutual support. They do not miss the compulsory visit to Varadero Beach. There, they were welcomed by the strong breeze of the Cuban autumn. In the evening they went to Kairos Center to enjoy a Christian Music Festival with groups and soloists of the city.</p><p>
This event closed with a service to celebrate the Reform Day.</p><p>
The conclusions of the event were gathered in the &ldquo;Letter of Matanzas&rdquo;, a document that expose dreams, make questions and propose a future of actions to achieve in our institutions, a Theology that reaffirm the hope proclaimed by Jesus: a new world of justice and peace is possible.</p><hr /><p><strong>
SOME IMPRESSIONS ABOUT THE INTERSEMINARY MEETING</strong></p><p>
Roberto Zwetsch, executive-secretary of the Theological and ecumenical Education Community in Latin America and Caribbean (CETELA), Lutheran Pastor and Professor of Practical Theology and Mission logy at the Superior School of San Leopoldo, Brazil.</p><p>
&ldquo;CETELA was not only summoned to participate in this meeting but also, we were consulted by Dr. Reinerio Arce Valentin about the celebration of this activity. We thought it was very important to know how is going the Theological Education, in our area, and which ones are its challenges. This meeting has given us the opportunity to learn ant to hear different emphasis and how each country is trying to respond to its ecclesiastical and national realities. It is important to meet agreement about the difficulties we face with the accreditation of the Theology studies in the High Education System to link them with the needs of the church and the service to people, without loosing the theological level we want to guarantee. It is necessary to contextualize but keeping ourselves on making a deeper theologian education.</p><p>
Another very important aspect is the issue of the finances. There is an increasing awareness we cannot depend on abroad. We should solve. In the measure we are able to, to get together our own resources to support a theological education without forgetting the collaborators&rdquo;</p><p>
&ldquo;I would like to remark the presentation made by the SET about the social projects supporting the communities. In Brazil, we have try to do the same, but we call it &ldquo;community action&rdquo;. I think, at SET you have more achieved since you have developed the four dimensions: theological, pastoral, diaconal and social within just one work&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;Besides, another very important aspect &ndash;according to him- was the meeting with the students agreement to create a student-of-Theology-network. He said that CETELA can support &ndash;and it is going to try- to start in 2009 a project to interchange students and professors, over all those having a large and stable faculty to serve the institutions&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;To finish &ndash;he said- it has been a very long standing dream to come to Cuba. I love a lot to have this contact. It is a beautiful opportunity to come here and to learn a theological experience searching for serving the churches and Cuban society. This is a seminary inserted within the national reality&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;I would not like to finish without saying that I loved Cuban music&rdquo;.</p><p>
Jose Duque, Ecumenical  Theological Education at the World Council of Churches and Professor at the Latin American Biblical University of San Jose, Costa Rica</p><p>
&ldquo;This has been a very new meeting. It is not common this kind of meeting. This summon made by the SET to share and to open ourselves to the area have had a very open and critic participation, since it tries to search for new ways to the theological education&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;Relating to the post-graduated studies &ndash;he said- &ldquo;the plan of a common doctorate to the area a worthwhile initiative to consider. The doctorate model should be a response to needs of the area. It is necessary to think about an alternative model. Today, it is very complex the financial matters. So, it should be adopted to such needs. The World Council of Churches will support this project&rdquo;, he declared.</p><p>
&ldquo;This was a very nice initiative from the students to bring up the creation of an association of Theology students. The matter has been brought at the Latin American Biblical University too. I think that, since the theological point of view, it would be very good. This initiative could be channelled into a project we call &ldquo;ecumenism and mission&rdquo;. It tries to achieve courses about ecumenical exchanges but with new meanings. The SET is able to be the place for a regional meeting of students- he concluded.</p><p>
Samuel Grano de Oro, Director of the Seminary of Theology of the Dominican Republic, Doctor of Theology and professor at that institution.</p><p>
&ldquo;The SET is the Alma Mater that has graduated many Dominican pastors, for instance the Vice-director of our Seminary Luis A Thomas, who came here with me. The best of our intelligentsia has been formed here. Cuba has always welcomed the Dominican and historically we have kept a very close communication with directors: first, Oden Marichal, after Ofelia Ortega and now Reinerio Arce and also with some professors&rdquo;, he said.</p><p>
&ldquo;This activity has been a very special opportunity to know Cuba. I have also been invited to participate in the Mastery Program Course, given by the SET&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;With this meeting, I have again connected myself to Cuba. This island is in the depth of my soul&rdquo;.</p><p>
Oneide Bodsin, Doctor of Sciences of Religion, Director and Professor of the High Studies of Theology School of San Leopoldo, Brazil and a Lutheran pastor.</p><p>
&ldquo;When I am in Cuba &ndash;Dr. Bodsin said this his second time in Cuba, in five years- I feel a big challenge. I am very interested in theological reflections within this cultural context. In Cuba and in Brazil, we need to make a dialogue with other cultures: the African and the indigenous ones&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;Other issues which call my attention in this meeting were the theological reflections within a context where there is no capitalist consumism&rdquo;. He was also impressed how solidarity among people is stronger than in his country.</p><p>
&ldquo;We wish we had exchanges between the institutions and we are thinking how to have a better benefit from the relationship between our seminaries than we already have and to have interchanges which really benefit the experiences. I think that a Theological Pedagogy is missing. The building up of an interface is needed. I could realize that in this meeting the theologians do not know Pedagogy and the pedagogues do not know Theology. We should consider the cultural context. I want to propose a process of discussions because I am convinced of all that&rdquo;, he added.</p><p>
Manuel Silva, Nicaraguan theologian and Moravian Pastor who works at present at the Intereclesiastical Center of Theological and Social Studies (CIEETS) in Managua, Nicaragua.</p><p>
&ldquo;This meeting is important since it summons us to look for hints, the pedagogical ones over all, which help us to a better insertion in the theological education in the needs of churches in the nation, for instance&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;To me this meeting is fundamental: in 1996, we were summoned here to set up a dialogue between the first Theology of Liberation and the second one. At that moment, the dilemma was the generational change and the reading of the Theology of Liberation not only since a political-economical approach, but the reading of the Theology of Liberation with different faces and hermeneutics. Now, this meeting is to find a Theology, a methodology into which the different interpretation can have a link with the community&rdquo;, he stated. &ldquo;We also have relations with the SET. We think to invite professors of this seminary to go to Nicaragua. We should make formal interchanges&rdquo;.</p><p>
&ldquo;I am very happy to be in Cuba!</p><p>
Sherron George, Theologian, missionary and pastor of the Presbyterian Church of US (PCUSA) who considers herself as Brazilian for adoption.</p><p>
Sherron told us that her task is to join the Presbyterian Church of US and South America. She also helps the PCUSA as consultant in the field of theological education in Latin America.</p><p>
&ldquo;The theological education is our priority. We support the five ecumenical centers of excellence. One of them is the SET&rdquo;, she stated. &ldquo;As for challenges, I think that one of the most important matter is the interchange South-South with the support of brothers and sisters from the North; the second one is to consider the theological education as solidarity and as competence. As observer, I am learning, accompanying, and supporting theological institutions&rdquo;, she concluded.</p><p>
Jim Hodgson, a catholic journalist. He works for the United Church of Canada as a responsible or the comradeship relations in the Caribbean, Central America and Colombia.</p><p>
&ldquo;On these days of work, we have talked about the opening of windows, for the exchanges of ideas. The financial issues also require our attention. As\ United Church, we think to keep faithful in the future for the theological education project in Latin America, over all Cuba which is a very special living space which contributes much to the churches&rdquo;.</p><p>
On the interseminary meeting, she said: &ldquo;there was a very good exchange of perspectives on the theological education process. I am very happy with this meeting, because it is necessary to strengthen the theological education network, to recognize it and to count on a mutual support, over all because the financial resources from the North are less and less&rdquo;, he pointed out.</p><hr /><p><strong>

INTERVIEWS</strong></p><p>
Interview to a great friend of the SET: Reverend Trilcia Lloyd-Siddle</p><p>
Reverend Trilcia Lloyd-Siddle from the Co-workers Mission of the Presbyterian Church of US  (PCUSA) &ndash;a great friend of the SET who in the Caribbean links both churches- attended to the meeting of making sisters the Presbyterian Church of US and the Presbyterian Church of Cuba, celebrated in our institution, 22 to 25 September. She also participated in the activities on occasion of the 62th anniversary of the foundation of the Evangelical Seminary of Theology.</p><p>
&ldquo;At the meeting of making sister the American and the Cuban Presbyterian Churches, said Reverend Lloyd-Siddle, participated 17 people from the United States and around 40 from Cuba. In this meeting, we devoted much of the time to come to know both contexts, about our churches and our countries as well; always with the intention that each relation with the churches in mission develops with the awareness of  a major context, that means including the situation of each country. Each local church is a piece of a major church and the Presbyterian Church is a part of the world and of a more complex reality.</p><p>
&ldquo;At the end of the event-she explained- the most of the guests came to their sisters&rsquo; churches to pay a visit. I decided to stay at the SET to accompany my sister church and the seminary, to meet Director Reinerio Arce and to participate in the activities for the anniversary of this dear institution&rdquo;.</p><p>
Lastly, she wanted to say &ldquo;leaving my country, I came very worried with the loss due to the two hurricanes. I wish to remark that the people of my country are really worried about Cuban people. Now, I go back more aware of a situation which I will share in my country. Solidarity between brothers and sisters is very important.</p><hr /><p><strong>
