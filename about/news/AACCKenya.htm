                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
                  <p>Peace and dialogue formed the essence of the message of the Nobel Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu during his recent visit to Kenya on January 3rd and 4th 2008. Archbishop Tutu was in the country as part of a solidarity visit together with Rev. Dr. Nyansanko-Ni-Nku, AACC President and Dr. Brigalia Bam, the Chairperson of the Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa, under the auspices of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC). The delegation was accompanied by the Rev. Dr. H. Mvume Dandala, General Secretary of the AACC, Rev Fred Nyabera, Executive Director for the Fellowship of Christian Councils in the Great Lakes Region and the Horn of Africa, Rev. Alphonse Kanga, PCEA moderator, Nairobi and the High Commissioner for South Africa, H.E. Mr. T.S. Msimang.</p>
                  <p>The visit was organised by the AACC following the disputed presidential election results which led to protests by the ODM supporters and the subsequent chaos that plunged the country into widespread violence, leading to loss of lives, massive destruction of property and displacement of people.</p>
                  <p>The AACC, in partnership with FECCLAHA initiated a series of meetings for the delegation to consult with church leaders and the political leadership in an effort to stem violence and open space for dialogue.</p>
                  <p>This saw the delegation hold meetings with the General Secretary of the NCCK, Rev. Canon Peter Karanja, President Hon. Mwai Kibaki and PNU leaders, Orange Democratic Party (ODM) and Orange Democratic Party- Kenya (ODM-K). Archbishop Tutu also held discussions with church leaders in the country and the EU Observer Mission.</p>
                  <p><strong>Rev. Canon Peter Karanja</strong></p>
                  <p>Rev. Peter Karanja assisted the delegation by giving them the history of Kenya to help them understand the current situation. Among the major issues he raised were that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The situation in Kenya is not an event but a historical process, as the current crisis dates back to independence days when many Kenyans felt that their expectations were not met and that certain communities have felt marginalized.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Violence is being used as a bargaining tool and for political reasons.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The nature of the conflict is being perceived in some circles as having an element of ethnic cleansing.<br />
</li>
                    <li>There is neither will nor capacity among the protagonists to lead the country forward. The situation calls for prayer, grace, humility and openness by all politicians and church leaders.<br />
</li>
</ul>
                  <p>He stressed that the NCCK is seeking to help the church leaders to find the position of independence that will enable them to minister effectively to all the sides involved in the conflict.</p>
<p>In his response Archbishop Tutu said it was horrible to see, on television, Kenya being put at the same level with Pakistan. He lamented that many innocent lives were being lost and thousands of Kenyans displaced. The situation in Kenya reminded him of what happened in South Africa prior to 1994 General Election. Archbishop Tutu however expressed optimism that the situation would change if the two leaders would be willing to dialogue.</p>
                  <p>On his part, the AACC President pointed out that Kenya was facing a challenge that was a litmus test for the church in Kenya as protagonists of truth, peace and reconciliation. He added that the church has to profile peace and stressed that the cry of Christians must be &lsquo;come let us reason together&rsquo;.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Pentagon ODM Leadership</strong></p>
                  <p>Speaking at the Pentagon House whilst meeting with the ODM team, the Archbishop praised Kenya as a country that has made everybody proud, adding that it has been a haven of peace. He then said that the purpose of the visit was to offer a listening ear and stand in solidarity with the church and the people of Kenya. Responding to Archbishop Tutu&rsquo;s remarks Hon. Raila Odinga appreciated the visit by the Archbishop and his team. He said that</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>People don&rsquo;t have to die because a country has gone through an election.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Kenya, as part of the international community, must sustain the same level of democracy as other countries.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The elections were rigged at ECK headquarters offices during the tallying process of the presidential votes. There was indisputable evidence. Even the ECK chairman himself Mr. Samuel Kivuitu and EU observers have raised their concerns.<br />
</li>
                    <li>As ODM, they demanded truth and justice and requested that the cause and not the symptom of the crisis be addressed. He was emphatic that ODM is open to discussion but only after President Kibaki publicly acknowledges that results were rigged and that he was in office illegally.<br />
</li>
</ul>
                  <p>Responding to the ODM the Archbishop&rsquo;s delegation</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Lamented that people are dying and stressed the need to find a way to stem the violence.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Wondered whether there could be a win-win situation and suggested that an interim government might be a possible way forward to help the country return to normalcy.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Said that the delegation did not wish to prescribe anything but only encourage discussions with the other parties to find a common ground, wisdom and cessation of violence because the consequences of this crisis will affect other countries.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Noted the lack of sufficient mechanism to deal with post election differences in Africa.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Cautioned that even when peace does return, the scars of those affected will remain just like in South Africa where the bitterness still runs deep and those with scars have never forgiven their aggressors. This will call for a clear process of healing to continue.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The meeting ended with a reiteration by ODM that they are open to mediation as they have ideas to put on the table for the way forward for the country.</li>
                  </ul>
<p><strong>President&rsquo;s Office</strong></p>
                  <p>The President and the Archbishop met privately first, and their delegations joined them later. The Archbishop&rsquo;s delegation</p>
<ul>
                  <li>Conveyed its condolences for those who have died, regretted the confusion around the elections and the subsequent violence that had visited the country and expressed hope that a speedy resolution is found.<br />
</li>
                  <li>Expressed hope that a government of national unity or some form of acceptable inter-party cooperation might be considered.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>The President&rsquo;s delegation responded that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The president cannot relinquish his office in order to talk to anybody because he has been elected legally.<br />
</li>
  <li>They would not support the idea of a Government of National Unity as it might indicate that the president is accepting the allegation that he has not been legitimately elected.<br />
</li>
  <li>They cannot support the re-tallying of the Presidential votes only, because the parliamentary and civic election had some sort of irregularities as well.<br />
</li>
  <li>They do not accept the EU Observer Mission Report because the EU observers did not speak to them.<br />
</li>
  <li>No agents were thrown out except in Nyanza Province where PNU agents suffered and that there were no irregularities in the tallying of the votes.<br />
</li>
  <li>The current violence was pre-meditated and the reality is the ethnic cleansing of the Kikuyu and Kisii communities.<br />
</li>
  <li>There is a need for a strong voice to tell the people the truth.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>The President ended by urging the churches to support the constitutionally elected government.</p>
<p>In response the Archbishop said that these issues need to be looked at beyond the current scenario because even the observers are raising questions on the legality of the electoral process. He stressed that the stopping of the mayhem of violence has got to be the priority for all involved.</p>
                  <p><strong>Meeting with the ODM &ndash;K</strong></p>
                  <p>ODM-K said that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Throughout its campaign, it has played a neutral role.<br />
</li>
                    <li>President Kibaki had won the election and that this was confirmed by all the agents who participated in the Verification Committee.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The PNU and the ODM were both guilty of rigging the polls.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The report of the Verification Committee signed by all party agents is alleged to be missing.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The only way forward for the ODM is through the courts, as they themselves are filing petitions for ten constituencies that they are disputing.<br />
</li>
                    <li>The church should not only reach out to the two key leaders &ndash;President Mwai Kibaki and Hon. Raila Odinga but also those close to them.<br />
</li>
                    <li>There was no need for international mediation. Rather the church in Kenya could assist the various parties to find common ground to resolve the impasse.<br />
</li>
</ul>
                  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Whilst the AACC is still in the process of analysing this information further, it wishes to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Affirm the leadership of the local churches in their response to this crisis.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Commits itself to support and accompany the churches in Kenya in this process in any possible manner that would be of help to them.<br />
</li>
                    <li>Appreciate the welcome of Archbishop Tutu&rsquo;s visit by the churches of Kenya, and hopes that this visit contributed to the rekindling of hope and confidence amongst them to resolve the problem.</li>
