                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
                  <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Post  Presidential Election Realities</strong><br />
                      <strong>A  Statement by a group of Bishops</strong></p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless  of how they voted, many Sri Lankans strongly disapproved of three trends during  the campaigning. These were: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>continuous personal slander, provoked by undue media       publicity. As the norms of vigorous and healthy democratic debate were       disregarded this way, the people were denied an objective understanding of       the real issues. </li>
                    <li>The wilful violation of electoral laws which sadly demonstrated       that might is right. The Election Commissioner&rsquo;s public confession amply       endorsed this. </li>
                    <li>The unprecedented amount of money spent on the campaigning. This       raises ethical questions of leadership qualities in a country striving to       eliminate poverty and bring justice to the IDPs. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Our  political leaders can still rectify these trends by setting self-imposed codes  of conduct, especially as we approach a general election. A voter preference  for those who demonstrate this change will result in a welcome transformation  of our political culture. Such a change will endorse the sovereignty of  the people. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">Promotions,  transfers, termination of services and the resignations of some Military,  Police and Public Services personnel send worrying messages about rewards and  punishments for certain styles of political behaviour. Competency in public  officials is to be appreciated and those who have done their duty well, need to  be commended. But administrative changes, immediately after a public  event that requires the impartiality of all officials, undermines good  governance. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">We  should take serious note of the majority who did not vote in some Tamils areas.  The lack of transport deprived thousands of IDPs from voting. The behaviour of  those who could but did not vote may indicates a lack of confidence in an  electoral contest between two primary candidates, which offered little in terms  of the problems faced by Tamils. Their silence may be seen as a clear message  that their expectations were not being addressed.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">It  is bad practice when elections are followed with the intimidation and  harassment of candidates, their supporters and those in the media who have  freely expressed their views. The total lack of information regarding  journalist, Mr. Eknaligoda, missing since two days before the election, is a  most disturbing case in point. The Police have an immediate responsibility to  investigate and prevent such happenings. The President, and all political,  civil society and religious leaders are called to set the standards in healing  tensions and ensuring justice and protection for all. </p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;">From  here we need to collectively address the pressing priorities of  political  devolution, good governance, media freedom, economic development, the  application of equal rights for the vulnerable, the total independence of the  judiciary and poverty alleviation, faced by our country. We urge the President,  the Cabinet and the Opposition to work towards these goals with purpose and  commitment. The test of a campaign is the urgency and priority given to the  needs of all the people by all candidates when the campaigning ends. None who contests  has the right or the luxury to continue with personal hurts, personal glory or  personal agendas.</p>
                  <p style="text-align:justify;"></p>
                  <p>With the assurance of our  prayers for all.</p>
