SET and the Anglican   Church of Canada have worked in partnership for many years on issues of   importance in theological education in Cuba and Canada.&nbsp; An annual   Partnerships grant supports Episcopal students at the seminary, as well   as the Mauricio Lopez Chair in Social Analysis and Social Justice,&nbsp;and SET&rsquo;s   general operating costs.</em>&nbsp;</p>

                  <hr />
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">17 September 2008 </p>
                  <p class="photoleft" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="images/SETchapel.jpg" width="300" height="224" alt="chapel at SET" />                  SET chapel </p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">Dear brothers, dear   sisters,</p>
                  <p>&nbsp;On behalf of our Seminary, we   would like to extend to you our most heartfelt thanks for your solidarity with our   people and our Church. We Cuban men and women are experiencing, at this moment,   the pain for the damage, not only to thousand of homes, many of them completely   destroyed, but also to schools, hospitals, theatres, and cultural heritage of   the nation; as well as to crops, and production and service facilities.&nbsp; It is a   very painful picture. Many people have to face the loss of all their   goods.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to God, human lives have   been safeguarded and loss of life has been at a minimum (7 persons), taking into   consideration the magnitude of this natural disaster.&nbsp; We ask you to pray with   us for the families of those that have lost their lives.&nbsp; Likewise, we ask you   to continue praying for our people and the peoples of the Caribbean that have   also been affected by the battering of these two hurricanes.</p>
                  <p>In our Seminary, losses have been   minimal, compared to the reality faced in many places in the rest of the   country, including our own Matanzas province. Despite that all necessary   measures were taken in order to protect our properties and goods,   four computers were ruined, because water entered the computer classroom.&nbsp; Four   windows at the section of the library where books are stored came off.&nbsp;   Fortunately, the windows did not fall and the books were not damaged.&nbsp;   Nevertheless, the windows need repair.&nbsp; Besides, a wall fell and the cabin of   the vegetable garden where seedlings are grown was lost.&nbsp; Some plantings were   also lost.</p>
                  <p class="photoright" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><img src="images/Andreis-episcopalianand-Haydee-baptist-2.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="two students at SET" /><br />
                  Students at SET </p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">However, we can share with you a   beautiful experience in the middle of so much anguish. The Seminary housed over   50 persons, as requested by the Civil Defense, because their homes were in   danger of floods or collapse. The group of persons evacuated was, mainly, sick   people and pregnant women. The students that remained in our facilities and our   workers took care of them all the time they sheltered in our institution.&nbsp; It is   the kindness of the Lord that gave us the possibility to show, with concrete   deeds, the love we proclaim.</p>
                  <p>We thank our good God, once   again, for your solidarity, friendship, and brotherhood.&nbsp; And we pray so that   all our people can feel, in such difficult times, the presence of His Holy   Spirit, comforting and sanctifying, especially through our many concrete deeds   of love we will try to multiply, to feed the hope that we will succeed one more   time.</p>
                  <p>Fraternally in Christ   our hope,</p>
