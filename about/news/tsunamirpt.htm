                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" --><em><strong>Tsunami Response<br />
                  Wednesday 11th April 2007
                  </strong></em>
                  <p><strong><img src="images/GIZO2010.jpg" alt="image" width="300" height="199" align="right" />1.            Introduction -- COM Disaster Committee</strong><br />
                  The Church of Melanesia Disaster Committee met on the 10th of April, a week after the tsunami struck the Western and Choiseul Provinces under the Chairmanship of the General Secretary, Mr. George Kiriau. The secretariat is the office of the Mission Secretary, Revd Canon Sam Sahu.</p>
                  <p>The Western and Choiseul Provinces are part of the Diocese of Ysabel. The people are predominantly United Church or Roman Catholic members. Anglicans make up only a small percentage of the total population of the two provinces and there has been long established mutual religious, social and cultural bonding since the colonial days.</p>
                  <p>The committee met and deliberated on the Church&rsquo;s response to the tsunami and to identify financial resources for immediate assistance to the victims as well as having to begin thinking about longer term infrastructure rehabilitation and development of Church buildings and other Church facilities destroyed by the tsunami.</p>
                  <p><img src="images/GIZO3010.jpg" width="196" height="130" alt="image" /> <img src="images/GIZO4027.jpg" width="197" height="130" alt="image" /></p>
                  <p> 
                    <strong>2.            Sources of information</strong><br />
                    Despite the lack of detailed information available for the committee to work on, the available and reliable report was of the Diocesan Bishop&rsquo;s visit to Gizo over the Easter weekend after the tsunami struck, together with first hand information gathered from the people themselves and St. Luke&rsquo;s Anglican parish committee members in Gizo. An assessment was carried out on Anglican villages Rendova and other villages regarding the number and location of families affected, properties damaged or destroyed and lives lost or injured.</p>
                  <p class="photoright"><img src="images/GIZO4033_000.jpg" width="300" height="199" alt="image" />Bishop Richard Naramara, Diocese of Ysabel, inspects tsunami damage</p>
                  <p><strong>3.         Key findings</strong><br />
                    Based on the Bishop&rsquo;s report and other reliable sources, the key findings were;</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Some people are traumatized and still fearful of returning from the hill tops.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>The number of Anglicans affected is approximately 1500 and the total number of those affected is about 5000.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>People are in need of clean drinking water, food, shelter, clothes, cooking utensils and proper sanitation.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>There is an urgent need to assist Anglicans first and foremost and then the rest later through other means such as the Provincial disaster committees or similar committees set up. There has been report of unfair distribution of food and other humanitarian assistance and responsible authorities are getting the situation under control.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>There needs to be proper coordination and monitoring of food supplies and other assistance for the next 3-6 months and then they should be assisted with roofing iron for their Church building and homes as well.<br />
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>4.            Financial resources</strong><br />
                    The Church&rsquo;s disaster budget for this year is SBD $30,000 and SBD $10,400 was given to the Bishop to assist the people during his visit to Gizo over the weekend. His diocese also contributed a substantial amount of money and a donation of SBD $10,000 was made to the Premier of Western Province. Similar gesture will also be rendered to the Premier of Choiseul Province as a show of the Church&rsquo;s support to the broader community.</p>
                  <p>Funds available to date were from various sources as well as from the Church of Melanesia&rsquo;s disaster budget for 2007.</p>
                  <p>Other Church partners and organizations have already pledged their financial support and that will be vital for the on going assistance the Church needs to give to its people as well for the long term rehabilitation and reconstruction of Church buildings and homes for people to move into and begin rebuilding their lives.</p>
                  <p>A total of 215 Anglican families have been affected and the figure has been used by the committee to calculate the initial assistance it can give, taking into account limitations faced, such as the vessel&rsquo;s loading capacity, limited resources, the remoteness of communities affected and the high shipping cost involved in terms of fuel and lubrication.</p>
                  <p>The following basic items have been identified, purchased and shipped to Gizo en route to Rendova (a big Anglican community swept by the tsunami) as the Church&rsquo;s initial assistance per family unit. On going assistance will follow after further assessment on the situation in the two provinces. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> 
                      1 Bag of Rice<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>1 Water jerry can<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>1 Kerosene lamp<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>6 Mosquito nets<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>1 Cooking pot<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>1 Kettle<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>6 Plates<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>6 Cups<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>6 Spoons<br />
                      </li>
                    <li>2 Bush knives<br />
</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>                      Total amount spent on items per family is<strong> SBD $466</strong>. The total amount of money spent for 215 families is <strong>SBD $100,190</strong>. The remaining money is spent on bales of second hand clothes from local clothing shops in Honiara.</p>
                  <p>Assistance is also given to non-Anglican members through grants to the two Provinces, which is left to the provincial authorities to decide on how this would be best used. The committee will also be looking at ways to assist Choiseul Province besides the $10,000 grant. An additional <strong>$20,000 worth of rice</strong> will also be distributed by the two provincial disaster committees to the general populace affected.<br />
                      <br />
                      <strong>5.            Tsunami appeals</strong><br />
                    The Solomon Islands Christian Association had made an appeal to its member Churches to give the Easter Sunday&rsquo;s offering toward the victims of the tsunami.</p>
                  <p><strong>6.         Relief coordination and networking</strong><br />
                    Within the Anglican Church of Melanesia, the COM Disaster Committee will be responsible for the coordination and monitoring of assistance and relief from the dioceses and to ensure it is dispatched where it is intended. A number of dioceses have made appeals to their members and will be channeled through as well. The committee is linked to the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) as the overall Government body responsible for all disaster management and relief work. Information and progressive reports will be forwarded to NDMO at the same time up to date reports and feedback can be received and channeled through people concerned. Development Services Exchange (DSE), the umbrella body of all the NGOs in the country will also be informed duly. Efforts will be made to ensure proper coordination and communication is established between the different Government organizations, NGOs and Churches.</p>
                  <p>Within the COM Disaster Committee, the Provincial Finance Manager, MBM Accountant and the Aid and Program Officer through the office of the General Secretary and the Mission Secretary, will oversee the progressive reporting aspect of disaster relief activities the Church is engaged in and to ensure that our overseas mission and aid partners are informed and know how funds are expended.</p>
                  <p><strong>7.         The way forward</strong><br />
                    Following the terrible tsunami on the 2nd of April, responses have been overwhelming and seemed not been properly coordinated at first. There were complaints of unfair distribution of food and supplies not reaching remote areas affected. Since Gizo is the provincial capital of the Western Province, it has attracted more of the efforts and attention than the rest of the communities affected, in terms of food supplies and assistance. That has been addressed with the professional coordination and technical assistance by UNDAC and other organizations working in collaboration with the NDMO. The Church through the Bishop&rsquo;s visit to Gizo, fortunately has at least sufficient information to start with and it is through his report that the committee was able to identify the way forward in best reaching its members.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rehabilitation, reconstruction and rebuilding of lives and livelihoods </strong>will certainly take time and we are anticipating further financial assistance and support from our overseas and international partners. Peoples homes, Churches, livelihoods were destroyed, and need to be rebuilt hopefully sooner depending on the availability of funds and resources.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>The senior priest of Lawe region, Ysabel diocese</strong> will be touring and visiting the villages affected and on going monitoring and assessment of situation will be carried out after Southern Cross has returned.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>Communication</strong> is vital to be re-established to ensure that the committee is kept informed on the situation on a day to day basis.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>On going monitoring</strong> of the situation for the next 3-6 months and to look at infrastructure development and further assistance needed in collaboration and networking with NGOs, NDMO and other relief organizations engaged in the disaster relief work.<br />
                      </li>
                    <li><strong>Additional funds and resources</strong> will definitely be needed through on going support from the Church&rsquo;s overseas mission and aid partners and organizations especially toward reconstruction efforts given the lean capacity of the Church to respond to disaster of such magnitude and scale.<br />
                      Information sharing with our national and international partners through reports on a regular basis is in-built as part of our on going monitoring and feeding back to donors and overseas partners.<br />
                      </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>8.            Conclusion</strong><br />
                    We are anticipating that our partners will be kept informed as to the progress of the different levels of support and assistance we together have contributed to the people of God who have suffered from the terrible disaster.</p>
                  <p>                    It is only a week since the events of 2nd April and the committee would like to thank you for your support thus far, and we look forward for your continuous assistance one way or the way as we together, shoulder to shoulder, help rebuild lives and restore hope to the hopeless by the grace of God.</p>
