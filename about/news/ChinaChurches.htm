                      <strong>July 9, 2008</strong>--Christians in China are busily preparing to welcome the<br />
                    world as China hosts the 29th Summer Olympic Games, August 8-24, 2008.<br />
                    The China Christian Council and Beijing churches are making available<br />
                    nearly 100,000 free bilingual Gospels, New Testaments, and complete<br />
                    Bible editions. They will be distributed within the Olympic Village and<br />
                    in churches throughout Beijing and other Olympic venue cities.<br />
                    <br />
                    Individual churches have improved simultaneous interpretation<br />
                    facilities. Christians within the Beijing church community have<br />
                    responded to the call to train as Olympic chapel volunteers.<br />
                    <br />
                    China has the largest number of Internet users in the world. The China<br />
                    Christian Council has tapped into this resource and established a<br />
                    special Olympic Prayer Chain page on its official website. The Prayer<br />
                    Chain encourages &quot;a great network of Christians to ask for prayer,<br />
                    blessings, and peace on the Beijing Olympic Games,&quot; according to the<br />
                    website.<br />
                    <br />
                    Christians from all over China are posting prayers for a successful,<br />
                    peaceful, and Spirit-filled Olympics. The China Christian Council guides<br />
                    the administrative, spiritual, and ecclesiastical affairs of China's<br />
                    growing Protestant church community.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Unique Olympic-Edition Bibles</strong><br />
                    Fifty thousand copies of a special Olympic Chinese-English edition of<br />
                    the Four Gospels are already being made available to churches in<br />
                    Beijing. The Beijing Organizing Committee has especially allowed the<br />
                    China Christian Council to use the official Beijing Olympic logo free of<br />
                    charge for the edition's cover.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Four Gospels edition will also be distributed in the Olympic<br />
                    Village and at other Olympic sites and churches in Shenyang, Tianjin,<br />
                    Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao, said the Rev. Xu Xiaohong, who is in charge of<br />
                    Bible printing and Christian publications for the China Christian<br />
                    Council.<br />
                    <br />
                    In addition, the Beijing Christian Council has commissioned 30,000<br />
                    bilingual editions of the New Testament and 10,000 copies of the entire<br />
                    Bible, also for free distribution. According to the Rev. Qi Tieying,<br />
                    vice-principal of Yanjing Theological Seminary, each of these editions<br />
                    contains a list of churches in Beijing and times of worship services.<br />
                    <br />
                    A joint-venture with the United Bible Societies (UBS), the Amity<br />
                    Printing Company in Nanjing printed the Gospels, New Testaments, and<br />
                    Bibles. Amity Printing is a division of the Amity Foundation, a<br />
                    long-standing Global Ministries partner and Chinese social service<br />
                    organization.<br />
                    <br />
                    Christians in China formed Amity to make Christian presence in social<br />
                    services more widely known to the Chinese people. Its printing press,<br />
                    established in 1987, gives priority to the printing of the Bible and<br />
                    Christian literature.<br />
                    <br />
                    UBS has called the Amity Printing Company one of the best printers of<br />
                    the Bible in the world. In total, Amity has printed and distributed<br />
                    nearly 55,000 copies of the Bible in China through a network of 70<br />
                    Bible-distribution centers organized by the China Christian Council.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Olympic Chapel Volunteers</strong><br />
                    Beijing churches have come together to provide volunteers for the<br />
                    Olympic Village chapel. Volunteers must be deeply committed Christians<br />
                    and have a good knowledge of English, one of the main languages used for<br />
                    communication in such a multicultural setting.<br />
                    <br />
                    Ms. Wang Qiong, a student and native of Shaanxi province, is one of<br />
                    several Protestant chapel volunteers from Yanjing Theological Seminary<br />
                    in Beijing. &quot;There are nine students and six teachers from Yanjing<br />
                    Seminary who will be part of the chapel volunteer system,&quot; said Ms.<br />
                    Wang, who comes from a Christian family.<br />
                    <br />
                  Ms. Wang's work will be challenging. Chapel volunteers will:</p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">help lead Christian  worship<br />
                    assist with devotions<br />
                    be available for prayer<br />
                    assist with an on-call 24-hour rota to offer general assistance to<br />
                  those in need.</p>
                  <p style="margin-top:0;">Yanjing Seminary is one of 18 theological seminaries  and Bible colleges<br />
                    sponsored by the China Christian Council. It is in geographic proximity<br />
                    to the Olympic Village and stadium in north-central Beijing.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Churches Prepare</strong><br />
                    Individual Beijing churches are excited to greet visitors from all over<br />
                    the world. &quot;There are 20 large churches in Beijing municipality ready to<br />
                    receive Olympic visitors,&quot; said the Rev. Yu Xinli, Chair of the Beijing<br />
                    Christian Council.<br />
  <br />
                    Beijing's Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Haidian churches each seat more than<br />
                    1,000 people. Churches are rearranging their courtyards in anticipation<br />
                    of the need for overflow space.<br />
  <br />
                    Christian English-language majors are learning how to simultaneously<br />
                    translate, ready to volunteers their services. For the past two years,<br />
                    the YM/YWCA in Beijing and other Olympic venue cities have been offering<br />
                    English-language classes for shopkeepers and taxi drivers.<br />
  <br />
                    Places of Worship Listed on the Beijing Olympic Website<br />
                    Welcoming the world to China through the Olympic Games also means<br />
                    welcoming religious faiths other than Christianity. The official website<br />
                    of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games has dedicated several pages to &quot;Places<br />
                    of Worship in Beijing,&quot; which include Buddhist and Daoist temples,<br />
                    mosques, as well as Protestant churches and Catholic cathedrals.<br />
  <br />
                    Since the early 1950s church structure in China is post-denominational.<br />
                    While there are no longer overseas denominations in China, there are<br />
                    thriving, vibrant and growing Christian churches throughout the People's<br />
                    Republic of China.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Christianity in Beijing</strong><br />
                    According to Rev. Yu, Beijing municipality has 20 churches and over 700<br />
                    meeting points--places of worship under the guidance of local churches.<br />
                    Approximately 50 ordained clergy and dozens of lay workers in the<br />
                    capital municipality nurture 60,000 baptized Christians and thousands<br />
                    more &quot;seekers,&quot; those showing interest in Christianity but not yet  ready<br />
                    to commit their lives to Christ. Several church-run ministries range<br />
                    from kindergartens, homes for the elderly, and church-run medical<br />
                    clinics attached to churches as outreach ministries.<br />
  <br />
                    Within mainland China there are an estimated 20 million protestant<br />
                    Christians and 12 to 15 million Catholics, according to the statistics<br />
                    of the China Christian Council and Chinese Catholic Patriotic<br />
                  Association.</p>
