                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
    <p style="margin-top:0;"><span style="color:#333333;">On August 11, 2005, aboriginal Anglicans, meeting in Pinawa, Manitoba called for their own bishop. The fifth Sacred Circle, a gathering of First Nations and Metis Anglican leadership has taken the historic step of requesting the Primate and the Anglican Church of Canada to provide them with a national aboriginal bishop within one year.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#333333;">The Anglican Council of Indigenous People (ACIP) signed The Covenant in 1994. This document declared that Indigenous Canadian Anglicans would make moves to be a self-determining community. The call for an indigenous national bishop is the bold, first step toward the growth of an indigenous Anglican Church.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>The call for a bishop states</strong>:</span></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><span style="color:#333333;">In the name of God the Creator. Amen. The Fifth sacred Circle-2005, meeting in Pinawa, Manitoba, being guided by the Holy Spirit, calls on the Primate and the Anglican Church of Canada to provide a national aboriginal bishop within one year. This bishop will have episcopal and pastoral responsibilities as well as full authority and jurisdiction for aboriginal communities across the country. This bishop will be fully recognized by the Anglican Church and be welcoming of aboriginal teaching, traditions, and ceremonies. The bishop will have spiritual support from the whole Church and will be monetarily supported so the Indigenous Anglican Church stands strong and independent of any subordination. The </span><span style="color:#3D3D3D;">provision of this bishop is a first step in a new era for the Indigenous Anglican Church.</span> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span style="color:#3D3D3D;">During the Fifth Sacred Circle, meeting from August 8 to 13, 2005, a clear consensus called for a national Native bishop as a first step toward self-determination. The call for a bishop was first presented to 41 elders in attendance at the Sacred Circle. One by one, the elders spoke of their generations-long hope for an indigenous Anglican Church. Many recounted the pain of their family members and relatives who suffered in the residential schools or who were wounded by the rejection of their aboriginal cultural teachings, ceremonies and traditions. The elders believed an indigenous bishop who welcomed aboriginal teachings and ways as a manifestation of native Anglicanism would heal wounds and open the doors of the Anglican Church to indigenous youth.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#3D3D3D;">After tearful appeals and heartfelt support, all 41 elders approved the request for a national indigenous bishop. Following First Nations protocol they each spoke their agreement with the call.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#3D3D3D;">During the afternoon of August 11, the leadership of the ACIP read the call for a national indigenous bishop to the entire Sacred Circle. Speakers lined up at the microphones to speak their support for this call. Many </span><span style="color:#3E3E3E;">persons tearfully recalled generations of ancestors who loved the Anglican Church and who hoped for a strong aboriginal church. Others wept as they stated their hope that an indigenous bishop would model the wholeness and healing that is so desired by those wounded by the residential school experience. At the end of extensive aboriginal testimony, one by one, the Sacred Circle participants stated their agreement with the call for a national indigenous bishop.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#3E3E3E;">Throughout the talks by aboriginal speakers the primate, Andrew Hutchison, and the bishops of the north listened, wept, nodded, and smiled. At the end of the many speakers three youth delegates approached the Primate and handed him the document calling for a national indigenous bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Primate accepted the document of call and blessed the youth. In return the youth laid hands on the primate to pray a blessing for him and to acknowledge the solemnity of this request. Many participants and bishops were weeping at the intensity of this historic moment.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#3E3E3E;">The Primate and bishops gathered on the platform and formally accepted the request. The Primate and the bishops pledged their efforts to see that this call was answered. After asking God's blessing on this call and response the </span><span style="color:#3F3F3F;">Primate gave The Peace to the Fifth Scared Circle. Tearful embraces were everywhere with individuals saying they were grateful to have lived to see this day.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:#3F3F3F;">On Friday, August 12, the Sacred Circle empowered ACIP to work out the details of selecting the national indigenous bishop. Each delegate spoke his or her assent to this plan. Some spoke of the Sacred Circle as the &quot;General Synod&quot; of the Indigenous Anglican Church and ACIP as the &quot;Council&quot; of the Indigenous General Synod. ACIP was commissioned by prayer of the Primate and the call of the Sacred Circle delegates and ACIP is, &quot;We are the Church!&quot;</span></p>
