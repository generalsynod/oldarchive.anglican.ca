    <h2><strong>WE SHOULD HAVE A DEADLINE</strong></h2>
    <p>The Anglican Church of Canada should have a national native bishop in place in the next three years, according to the Rt. Rev. Beardy, former diocesan bishop of Keewatin.</p>
    <p>Bishop Beardy made the challenge to the Sacred Circle following the Evening Prayer service led by Quebec and Labrador.</p>
    <p>&quot;If the Anglican partners are serious, let's stop talking. Let's see results. As partners, if we minister together, let's see it move in trust of each other,&rdquo; he said.</p>
    <p>Bishop Beardy talked about his work with the Tribal Council in Shoal Lake on Residential Schools.</p>
    <p>He is proud of the Anglican Church because, &quot;in every meeting with large groups, there's always an Anglican there, reaching out to other people. Reaching out is important, as a lot of our First Nations people were abused sexually and emotionally, stripped of every kind of dignity there was.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Today, we're on a journey to make amends, not only to ourselves but to the nations around us.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The former diocesan bishop explained that when he became bishop, many told him how overjoyed they were. They were dancing in the street.</p>
    <p>&quot;Even my people were dancing, it meant there was hope. Our nation was being built to become proud.&quot; He said, adding there is a wrong pride and a righteous pride. &quot;We need to be proud of who we are.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bishop Beardy challenged the church to take a bold step and create a national native bishop, one who will bring hope and instil pride across the country.</p>
    <p>&quot;Then, all our natives will see we are equal, truly brothers and sisters, not only in word but in action.''</p>
    <p>&quot;In order to accomplish the vision, there needs to be trust, which comes by knowing everything is okay. Your life will be a priority with the person, so it must be a person who will build trust between Anishinabe and our white brothers and sisters.&quot;</p>
    <p>The national native bishop could act in such a capacity, building up the community. We also need prophets of our own, of our own tribe, who are recognized as saints, so every Aboriginal child can be proud and practice the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>Members gave Bishop Beardy a standing ovation as he closed with singing &quot;All over the World,&quot; the song recorded on the CD Trail of Hope.</p>
    <p>The day began with a ceremony at the sacred fire. In the morning, the Sacred Circle heard from the Rev. Mervin Wolfleg, chair of the Indigenous Covenant Implementation Commission (ICJC) that is looking at the reality of having an Anglican indigenous bishop.</p>
    <p>To put the covenant into perspective, Rev. Wolfleg shared his own story of attending a Residential School, of leaving the institutional church for a time and recovering his traditional ways. He spoke of a powerful vision from his grandmother that urged him to return to the church.</p>
    <p>&quot;When your grandma tells you to go, you go. Alive or not,&quot; he said. Today, the ICIC chairperson sees the covenant in action in the &lsquo;Prairie Chickens&rsquo;, a group young people who are demonstrating Circle of Courage values spoken of by the Rev. Canon Dr. Martin Brokenleg.</p>
    <p>&quot;Here they were (at the Sundance ceremonies), totally willing and helping the elders and younger people. There was a sense of belonging in these young people. They did the chores, they got ready, they all danced.&quot;</p>
    <p>When talking about the office of an indigenous bishop, Rev. Wolfleg suggested there were three kinds of leaders&mdash;ones traditionally recognized, leaders recognized by the larger church and leaders recognized by both.</p>
    <p>&quot;Our package (at this Sacred Circle) attempts to seek that third person, a rare leader. I'm glad Bishop Beardy will be here. He was, in my opinion, that kind of leader, able to walk both paths.&quot;</p>
    <p>Rev. Wolfleg closed with a message given to him from a 93-year-old Anglican elder. &quot;Go to your meeting and tell the people to remember us, the people in the pews, at home. Pray for our children and great grandchildren and remember that we are also a part of the church. Tell the people those pews are empty, but there are people who can't make it to church, but are praying for you.&quot;</p>
    <p>The ICIC chair closed his talk with a prayer song. In the afternoon, discussion groups shared their thoughts on the presentation and what the church should be doing. Groups reported back in the late afternoon. The day concluded with a Gospel Jamboree.</p>
    <h2>WEATHER</h2>
    <p>Partly cloudy, cooler, chilly in the evening.</p>
    <h2><strong>OSKAPESUK (HELPERS - CREE)</strong></h2>
    <p>It has been my privilege to be Oskape, a helper to this gathering. This means doing odd jobs and, when I'm not &quot;busy&quot;, looking for those who seem to be alone and praying for every participant I have noticed many other helpers. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loon standing vigil to the west of the sacred fire. </li>
      <li>Eagle crying to Creator on the second day, &quot;Here! Here!&quot; </li>
      <li> Fire Keeper upholding our sacred purpose with prayer and teaching. </li>
      <li> A dog sharing his ball with one of our children. </li>
      <li> Young women singing while we walk to lunch. </li>
      <li> Musicians playing joyfully in the spirit of children. </li>
      <li> Record keepers listening intently that we all might hear. </li>
      <li> Technicians adjusting mikes and volume. </li>
      <li> Tears bringing healing to those who cannot cry. </li>
      <li> Table partners making every meal a communion. </li>
      <li> Elders and presenters touching spirits at their deepest parts. </li>
      <li> Servers filling both plates and hearts with smiles. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>What helpers have you noticed? </p>
    <p>Memory keepers: Frank Armistead (Lutheran partner to ACIP) and Freda Bear </p>
    <h2>SIGHTINGS</h2>
    <p>During the 6:30 a.m. ceremony at the sacred fire an eagle visited the twenty participants when they finished smoking the pipe. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vultures have been seen. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>WORSHIP</h2>
    <p>&quot;The story of the Dakota hymn, and the massacre was very moving. We don&rsquo;t realize how much healing can go out from this gathering to the abusers.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I've been impressed by Billy's devotion to prayer, engaging, people, teaching people, being supportive of what's happening in this place.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;His grandfather William Cochrane built churches in the Red River Valley.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Evening prayer was very moving - there was a certain atmosphere. Especially the powerful story of the Miracle Child and the singing of the closing hymn.&quot; </p>
    <h2>SPEAKERS</h2>
    <p>&quot;Phyllis Keeper's story really touched me. I found it really powerful how God touched her,&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Mervin Wolfleg is the perfect model of how powerful an elder can be - a godly elder - who speaks quietly and cares deeply. We were like loved children absorbing every word he said.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Gordon Beardy was very powerful&quot; </p>
    <h2><strong>FROM THE DISCUSSION GROUPS</strong></h2>
    <p>The Pinawa Declaration, presented by one of the sharing circle groups in response to the day's discussion questions was a highlight of the plenary report sharing. &quot;Given the crisis in our communities and to insure the survival of Anglicanism in our territories, we call for the election and consecration of 15 Aboriginal bishops within one year. These missionary bishops will be based in major southern cities and in the north. Each bishop is to be elected in a region. Each bishop will be supported spiritually and monetarily by Aboriginal people, sharing justly in the historic, invested wealth of the Anglican Church of Canada. These bishops will be full Anglican bishops treated as equals of non-Aboriginal bishops. They are to be welcoming of Aboriginal traditions, teachings, and ceremonies.&quot; </p>
    <p>Another circle reporter said they had given support to the idea of one national bishop but 15 would be better. In their model, the national bishop would have 4 advisors - elders -men and women from the four directions. This group proposed an Aboriginal diocese with the name ... &quot;Diocese of Turtle Island&quot;. </p>
    <h2>FROM THE BISHOPS</h2>
    <p>ACIP has affirmed this and I feel we should be supportive. This will be a transformative experience for the whole Church, not only the indigenous constituency. I think it will be a difficult process but will be for the good of the whole church. </p>
    <h2>TOUCHING MOMENT</h2>
    <p>Mervin Wolfleg led us in the Lakota hymn sung by victims of mass execution. The drum was made by Lutheran Partner, Frank Armistead. His teacher was a Chinese man who learned this art from Coast Shalish elders. The painting on the drum reflects the cedar teaching that we are to be firmly rooted in Mother Earth and stretch upward toward the Creator, seeking uprightness and good balance. Earth is blue (water color) to remind us that our primary purpose is female - the nurturing of life. Eagle is the symbol of elders. Red-tailed hawk, the bird of the Frank's vision, flies the same spiritual space, but lower. In his ministry he is to remain a little below the elders, giving way to their guidance and leadership. </p>
    <p>May this be a model for churches seeking to learn to walk together with the indigenous peoples of the world. </p>
    <h2>INTERESTING QUOTES</h2>
    <p>&quot;The Cree word for minister means 'prayer chief'. &quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Respect the northern lights - it is the spirits of those who have gone before, dancing.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The wind is God breathing on you, letting you know you are alive.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The rain is God crying - letting you know that he loves you.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Jesus didn't call governors and chiefs, but little people, and they left everything and followed him. They were uneducated, just people that Jesus chose. That's what we are here.&quot; </p>
