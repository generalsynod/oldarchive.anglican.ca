    HONORING OUR RELATIONS: KEEPING THE SPIRIT ALIVE<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h1>
                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" --><h2><strong>GATHERING CALLS FOR NATIONAL NATIVE BISHOP WITHIN A YEAR</strong></h2>
      <p>Indigenous Anglicans spoke with one voice today, calling for the creation of the office of a national native bishop within one year.</p>
      <p>After a moving message by youth member, Chris Bignell at the morning service led by the youth, a special meeting was called by the co-chairs of the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP) to discuss a growing desire to see the position of national native bishop created.</p>
      <p>The co-chairs called upon the wisdom of the elders and the 41 in attendance discussed the idea of a national native bishop.</p>
      <p>Elder George Campbell explained the task was to come up with a statement before the end of the Sacred Circle. The committee then decided it would not proceed until the elders had gathered.</p>
    <p>&quot;That was a very important step. Our elders participated and spoke well about the present and future need to move forward now.&quot;</p>
    <p>Campbell noted there was 100 percent agreement among the elders. The group returned to the Sacred Circle after lunch to hear from the total membership. Many spoke with passion and conviction and some shed tears of joy.</p>
    <p>&quot;I never thought in my life I would see this moment,&rdquo; said Shirley Johnson from the diocese of Huron. &quot;I say meegwetch (thank you) and plead with the Primate to accept this challenge.&quot;</p>
    <p>All of the speakers praised the efforts of the elders and leaders who brought the vision forward. A couple of speakers cautioned the gathering to consider the immense role of a bishop and that the person would need support.</p>
    <p>The Rev. Iola Metuq of the Diocese of the Arctic shared a vision he had while singing.</p>
    <p>&quot;Something emerged from the earth, from the ground, a chunk of rock. It wasn't in any shape. The word came. There's going to be a sacrifice, persecution. What we're doing is not easy. Those strong in the Lord will survive. If we try with our own will, our own purpose, it won't stand.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;To dream is easy. When it's reality we don't want it, that's the sacrifice. I urge people who are elected to be strong and pray and give guidance, it's just a rock right now. we have to shape it hand to hand.&quot;'</p>
    <p>Erwin Oliver of the Diocese of Huron noted that this process didn't happen in a vacuum, and he paid tribute to the hard work of outside help, such as the Maori and New Zealand bishops and pioneers in Canada such as the Rev. Adam Cuthand and Ernest Willie.</p>
    <p>&quot;We need to thank all of the work done by our predecessors and for our present day leaders for finishing the process.''</p>
    <p>Once everyone had been given a chance to speak, the gathering was invited to vote on the working document that had been presented. One by one, each member stood up and answered. ''I agree.&quot; to the document until everyone was standing. There was total consensus among the indigenous Anglicans in attendance and much rejoicing.</p>
    <p>The youth who had been invited to stand with the leaders on the stage presented the document to Andrew Hutchison, Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada.</p>
    <p>All seven bishops in attendance stood with the Primate and expressed their unanimous support of a national native bishop. However, the assembly was told it may take a longer period than one year to achieve the goal of a bishop with &quot;'full authority' and jurisdiction&quot; for aboriginal communities.</p>
    <h2>THE DECLARATION</h2>
    <p>In the name of God the Creator. Amen.</p>
    <p>The Fifth Sacred Circle- 2005 meeting in Pinawa. Manitoba, being guided by the Holy Spirit, calls upon the Primate and the Anglican Church of Canada to provide a national aboriginal bishop within one year. This bishop will have Episcopal and pastoral responsibilities as well as full authority and jurisdiction for aboriginal communities across the country. This bishop will be fully recognized by the Anglican Church and be welcoming of aboriginal teachings, traditions and ceremonies. The bishop will have spiritual support from the whole church and will be monetarily supported so the Indigenous Anglican Church stands strong and independent of any subordination. The provision of this bishop is a first step in a new era for the Indigenous Anglican Church.</p>
    <h2>YOUTH MESSAGE</h2>
    <p>Chris Bignell &quot;the bear who walks during the day'' was a powerful speaker who shared a message from the heart: stories of healing and traditional teaching. &quot;As babies, as toddlers, we look to our moms and dads. Some if lucky have two teachers. What if they are not well? Who leads us? The pain is what takes hold.&quot; The rattlesnake story &quot;you knew what I was when you picked me up&quot;, the painful story of addiction - &quot;the fire, I turned my back on, got out of control&quot;: Chris' vision of light on the Unity run to Ottawa, and the pain and thirst-bearing on that run was transformed by remembering the suffering of residential school survivors &quot;planted something in us&quot;, and we gave Chris a standing ovation. Chris left us with a question: &quot;What have you done to prepare your youth for tomorrow?&quot;</p>
    <br />
    <h2><strong>NEW MEMBER FOR ACIP</strong></h2>
    <p>ACIP's first self-determinative action was to honour a new relationship by offering membership on ACIP to partners from Alaska. &quot;We are a church without borders.&quot; In response, Bishop Mark MacDonald, ''big shirt'', affirmed. &quot;It is God's work&quot; and said from the heart, &quot;we are your children and to be welcomed home is wonderful.&quot;</p>
    <h2><strong>OTHER COMMENTS </strong></h2>
    <p><strong>On this historic day from the Memory Keepers: Shirley Johnson, Margaret Waterchief, Gordon Light:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;The amazing thing was that everybody agreed&quot;</li>
      <li>&quot;I was so happy I was crying&quot;.</li>
      <li>&quot;It's the work of the Holy Spirit. It's going to happen.&quot;</li>
      <li>&quot;There's never been the support of that many bishops.&quot;</li>
      <li>&quot;I'm thrilled that ACIP invited partner bishops this time.&quot;</li>
      <li>&quot;The most moving moment was as people stood up one by one to voice their agreement. There was a sacredness to that moment&quot;</li>
      <li>&quot;It's my 74th year and I've never seen anything like it. We were finally going to be free.&quot;</li>
      <li>&quot;It was so clear what God was asking of us.&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TIME FOR CELEBRATION</h2>
    <p>Following an excellent homily by the Ven. Sidney Black the community celebrated with both a round dance and square dance and lingering conversations.</p>
    <h2><strong>THANKS TO THE COCHRANE FAMILY</strong></h2>
    <p>The sacred fire was an essential part of the week in honoring the place of culture and tradition in an indigenous church. Many thanks to the Cochrane family for tending the fire and Bill for his teachings.</p>
    <h2>WEATHER</h2>
    <p>Cool and rainy with intermittent sun.</p>
