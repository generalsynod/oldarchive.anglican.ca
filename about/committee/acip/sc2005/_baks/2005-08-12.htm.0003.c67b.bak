  HONORING OUR RELATIONS: KEEPING THE SPIRIT ALIVE<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h1>
                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" --><p><strong>THE SACRED FIRE HAS STARTED</strong></p>
    <p>The process of selecting a national native bishop is underway after full consensus by members of the Sacred Circle.</p>
    <p>A total of 92 members stood one by one, saying &quot;I agree,&quot; and gave the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACFP) responsibility to nominate to the Primate a &quot;fit and qualified&quot; person to be appointed as the first National Indigenous Bishop.</p>
    <p>&quot;The process of selection is to be called The Sacred Fire. It has started,&quot; said the Rev. Mervin Wolfleg, chair of the Indigenous Covenant Implementation Commission (1CIC), whose mandate is now completed.</p>
    <p>The ACIP has also been asked by the Sacred Circle to &quot;adopt a process for the election of subsequent National</p>
    <p>Indigenous Bishops by a Sacred Circle representative of all Canadian Indigenous Anglicans,&quot; and to &quot;empower the National Indigenous Bishop with Episcopal and pastoral responsibilities as well as full authority and jurisdiction for aboriginal communities across Canada.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What a historic last few days,&quot; said Gloria Moses, co-chair of ACIP. &quot;Here we are on a historic day, August 12. We, the indigenous and non indigenous partners and friends, we thank you.&quot;</p>
    <p>Earlier in the morning, the Sacred Circle heard from the Ven. Dr. Hone T Kaa, partner from the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand. He came as a representative of the Indigenous people of the &quot;Land of the Long White Cloud.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Just like you, we, too, were discovered and claimed as part of someone else's Empire.&quot;</p>
    <p>The partner explained the Indigenous Anglican's &quot;journey of liberation&quot; mirrors theirs in Aotearoa, New Zealand, which began in 1928 when the first Maori bishop, Frederick Bennett, was elected and consecrated as a suffragan (assistant) bishop to a diocese.</p>
    <p>Full authority and jurisdiction was given to the bishop of Aotearoa in 1978 after the Maori had threatened to secede from the Anglican Church. The person was commissioned by each of the diocesan bishops to &quot;fulfill&quot; that ministry and the Maori mission committees in each of the seven dioceses were enabled to elect four persons to represent each respectively on the Bishopric of Aotearoa Council.</p>
    <p>&quot;This Council became in effect the Maori synod of the Bishopric,&quot; said Hone T Kaa.</p>
    <p>He explained in 1980 the third bishop retired and Maori &quot;at long last&quot; were able to elect their own bishop. Further self-determination acts included the process of defining what a &quot;bicultural church&quot; would look like. A treaty was signed with the British Crown as a result. Further revision of the Constitution of the Anglican Church in New Zealand and in 1990 was broadened to encompass the Diocese of Polynesia as a third partner.</p>
    <p>In 1992, Maori were able to establish five dioceses known as Amorangi and four new bishops were ordained.</p>
    <p>&quot;For the first time the Maori bishop could ordain other Maori bishops. This is the point towards which you will move. God willing, you will be able to do that by 2013.&quot;</p>
    <p>The New Zealand partner praised the Canadian church for its efforts this week.</p>
    <p>&quot;The power of what has been done here at Pinawa will linger for a long time. Its fragrance needs to spread throughout the Church in Canada. I pray that it does.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;To those of the bench of bishops present throughout this meeting, I am impressed by your patience, forbearance and love that has carried you through the days that you have been present. Your commitment to this Indigenous cause is a joy to behold.&quot;</p>
    <p>The sentiment was echoed by Malcolm Chun, General Secretary of the Anglican Indigenous Network (AIN), who pledged continuing support.</p>
    <p>&quot;I commend all of you, especially the bishops, for being so brave and strong. Your work has been good.&quot;</p>
    <p>In his address at the closing Eucharist, the Rt. Rev. Andrew Hutchison, Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada (ACC), said that when the petition for a national native bishop was presented by the youth to the Primate, they believed they had done a good thing. He added there will be challenges and perhaps suffering.</p>
    <p>&quot;If so, so be it. We have done what we believe is right and we, as bishops, have responded.&quot; He reminded the youth they are the &quot;hope and future&quot; of their people and their church.</p>
    <p>In a moving moment, the Primate called the youth to the altar along with the bishops, who stood before them. Robert Pike, representing the youth, then blessed the Primate and bishops.</p>
    <p>As part of the concluding events, a new tree was planted at the entrance to the Wilderness Edge Retreat and Conference Centre in Pinawa. Members of the Sacred Circle brought water from across Canada to water the tree. A give&shy;away was held under the main tent, followed by a group photo to mark this historic time.</p>
    <p><strong>FROM THE MESSAGE KEEPERS</strong></p>
    <p>Marge Panamick, Melva Black and Barbara Liotscos:</p>
    </p>
    <p>&quot;People have been happy to experience the diversity of languages and cultures across the Anglican Church of Canada.'' </p>
    <p>&quot;Some are reluctant to go home. They are not sure how their bishop will respond.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I saw the eagle - two eagles in the sky.&quot;</p>
    <p>QUOTES</p>
    <p>&quot;You are launching a new canoe. Let the calm be wide and the water like polished greenstone.&quot; Hone Kaa</p>
    <p>Martin Brokenleg commented that we were &quot;pouring new wine into old redskins!&quot;</p>
    <p>THANK YOU</p>
    <p>To all who worked at publishing the daily documents, especially the staff.</p>
