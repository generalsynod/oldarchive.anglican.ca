                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" --><em>Several of the Scared Circle participants wrote articles for their diocesan newspapers. With their permission, we reproduce those articles here. The snippets below may whet your appetite. </em>
    <p> When the missionaries landed on this land of Turtle Island the First Peoples recognized the Truth the missionaries talked about. They accepted Jesus because in many ways they already knew him. However, the missionaries also brought a way of life which meant the demise of a People. Native languages, cultural ways and spirituality were discouraged and in many cases forbidden. The effect of this form of oppression meant the destruction of the soul of a People.... It has been a joy to see the Creator rekindle the spirit of a people. Watching this growth has been like watching the blossoming of a delicate and fragrant flower whose beauty and fragrance will surely touch those around them. This Journey of Spiritual Renewal continues. &quot;As First Nations of this land, we are a people of hope and vision, and that vision will become clearer the more we gather together.&quot; <br />
          <em>Laverne Jacobs, Diocese of Huron</em> <br />
      <a href="news7.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
      </p><p> I was afraid to be a minority person amongst the native peoples and worried that I would be hated because I am a member of the dominant culture which is responsible for so much injustice and pain. Instead, I met my brothers and sisters in Christ who welcomed me, took me into their hearts, shared their stories and their pain, and reminded me that we must follow God's teaching on this healing walk together. <br />
          <em>Ann Keating, Diocese of Toronto</em> <br />
          <a href="news2.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
      </p><p> Ethel Ahenakew from the diocese of Saskatoon honoured the primate for his courageous stand for First Nations people and for his compassion. &quot;As head of the Anglican Church of Canada, you are the instrument God has chosen to orchestrate the Church to start over, after admitting to the wrongs that your ancestors have committed. We can now start building bridges so that white and aboriginal people can come together and become strong as a church, where you have laid a strong foundation with your apology.&quot; <br />
          <em>Debbie McClellan, Diocese of British Columbia</em> <br />
          <a href="news3.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
      </p><p> Gabriel Constant is a handsome young man with an air of quiet dignity about him. Wise beyond his years, he spoke about his own spiritual journey and his entrance into the Christian community. &quot;My father, now deceased, was an Anglican priest; my mother is now one too. But in my earlier years I couldn't connect the church with my own spiritual growth. What it had to do with me and Aboriginal culture and religion. I have slowly learned that the two are inter-connected.&quot; <br />
          <em>Erwin Oliver, Diocese of Huron</em> <br />
          <a href="news5.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
    </p><p> Challenge and support are the two aspects that showed up clearly during the Sacred Circle. The event was surrounded in prayer, worship, Bible study and fellowship. Each morning, during the worship, one of the five bishops delivered a major sermon. Members of the Sacred Circle then broke into small &quot;talking circles&quot; to reflect on the challenges raised. <br />
          <em>Murray Still, Diocese of Rupert's Land</em> <br />
      <a href="news6.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
      </p><p> What an honour it is to witness the healing that is taking place, to witness resurrection, then, like Mary Magdalene, to carry the responsibility to tell what we have seen. Like the gift of God's grace itself, the invitation to partnership has become a transformative force in the lives of those who have accepted the call. And like grace, it is wide: the invitation is extended to the whole church. <br />
  <em>Eileen Scully, Diocese of Huron</em> <br />
  <a href="news8.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
      </p><p> I went to the Sacred Circle expecting to be challenged; instead I was welcomed as a long lost family member... In fact, the only challenge I received, but one which I stress must not be taken lightly, came from another of the non-native partners, after I had made one too many protestations of our diocese's lack of native members. She asked &quot;Are we only supposed to be supporting 'Anglican' natives?&quot; <br />
          <em>David Watts, Diocese of Fredericton</em> <br />
          <a href="news1.htm">&lt;full article&gt;</a>
      </p><p> I went not knowing what to expect I would hear. Would it be stories of pain from the past or stories of healing and reconciliation and hope for the future? It turned out this was a community full of confidence and determination to move forward. Indigenous people who had attended other gatherings said they felt a sense of growth. One young person said: &quot;It's just like something new and exciting is happening here.&quot; <br />
