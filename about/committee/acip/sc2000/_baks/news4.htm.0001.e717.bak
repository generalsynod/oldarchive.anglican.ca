    The Anglican Church of Canada and the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples called aboriginal members of the Church to come together for the fourth Convocation of Native Ministry - the Sacred Circle - from Aug. 18 to 25. Held at the beautiful CAW Centre in Port Elgin, Ont., its theme was: Walking a New Vision. It was an opportunity for indigenous Anglicans to share what had happened on their journey since the last gathering in Lethbridge in 1997. </p><p>
Walking a New Vision was a gathering in the spirit of the Covenant that calls indigenous Anglicans &quot;into unity in a new self-determining community with the Anglican Church of Canada... (and) extends the hand of partnership to all those who will help us build a truly Anglican Indigenous Church in Canada.&quot; A total of 135 people, including six staff and three Anglican video people, met at Port Elgin and I was one of eight non-native participants invited. </p><p>
We were asked &quot;to be present with indigenous Anglicans as they discern together what they will bring to the life of our church in the 21st century,&quot; to join the circle and to find ways &quot;to walk a new vision of solidarity and respect.&quot; </p><p>
Why was the invitation so special? The answer is found in the words &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;trust,&quot; which were not there in great measure when the first native convocation was held in 1990. Indigenous Anglicans from across the country -- there are 225 native congregations -- met each other for the first time. They were able to air their concerns about their communities, their relationship with the dominant culture and with the Anglican Church. The only non-native invited was the Primate, Archbishop Michael Peers, who preached at the opening and closing Eucharists and spent the time in between as a silent witness. </p><p>
At the next gathering in 1993, a few more non-native observers were invited. They heard the horrific stories, full of pain, anger and hatred, as person after person recounted their experiences at residential schools and the ongoing breakdowns in family and community life. </p><p>
It was at this time that the Primate made his apology on behalf of the Church for the part the church had played. He pledged that action would be taken by the Church &quot;to walk with you along the path of God's healing.&quot; The apology marked a turning point. </p><p>
What emerged from a special consultation a year later in Winnipeg was the Covenant that saw the indigenous Anglicans as equal partners in a &quot;shared journey of healing moving towards wholeness and justice&quot; within the Church. </p><p>
At the 1997 convocation in Lethbridge, non-native partners were invited to join the indigenous people in an exploration of the meaning and significance of the Covenant. </p><p>
This year's gathering, now called the Sacred Circle, asked the partners to return to their communities and dioceses and tell the story of the Sacred Circle and the spiritual journey of the indigenous community as it moves forward to achieve the vision of the Covenant. </p><p>
I went not knowing what to expect I would hear. Would it be stories of pain from the past or stories of healing and reconciliation and hope for the future? </p><p>
It turned out this was a community full of confidence and determination to move forward. Indigenous people who had attended other gatherings said they felt a sense of growth. One young person said: &quot;It's just like something new and exciting is happening here.&quot; </p><p>
Without hesitation, they give the credit to God - God at work in them and in others has brought healing and reconciliation to many and has given them the willingness and confidence to leave the past behind. We began on the first morning with an Ojibway Eucharist service. The procession was led by a native priest drumming and chanting a traditional Blackfoot call to worship. An elder from the local Huron diocese blessed the room and gathering. She then welcomed everyone to Algonquin territory and prayed for the gathering. The Ojibway expression of the prayer, creed and Eucharistic prayer was new and beautiful to me. </p><p>
Dressed in his native vestments, the Primate in his reflections on John 17, explored the theme of unity and reminded us that we are the community called to be challenged by diversity but assured of the power of God and the presence of Jesus to be able to meet the challenge. </p><p>
Each morning a homily was given by a native bishop, including an international partner, Bishop Arthur Malcolm, the first and only aboriginal bishop of the Anglican Church in Australia. From our church, we were blessed to have Bishop Paul Idlout and Bishop Andrew Atagutaluk from the Arctic, and Bishop Charles Arthurson from Saskatchewan. </p><p>
Following the morning service, we met in sharing circles of 12 to14 people. Some of the guiding questions were: &quot;What are we going to do for healing and faith?&quot; &quot;What do we need for healing and faith on the way?&quot; &quot;What are you doing or going to do about reconciliation in your community?&quot; &quot;What do you need to gather strength in your community for the journey?&quot; Later the circles reported back to the plenary session. For most of those gathered, healing had occurred. </p><p>
However, some were still suffering. One man was trying to come to terms with the suicide of his teenage son three weeks earlier. Another man had come to realise that he still had some forgiving to do and was now able to do it. Many said they needed to reach out to those in their communities who have rejected Christianity and the Church. </p><p>
Some are having difficulty introducing some traditional practices into their services. Others still believe such practices are &quot;of the devil.&quot; </p><p>
The main message that emerged was that although there are still problems to solve and healing and reconciliation to achieve, they have the will and confidence to move forward and meet those challenges. The sharing in the circles was intense. It was good to have special times that helped us to relax, to laugh and have a change of pace. One evening we were entertained by Bishop Andrew on the accordion and by one of the partners on guitar. </p><p>
Bishop Paul joined in dancing a jig or two to the music. Bishop Malcolm delighted us with a boomerang demonstration. </p><p>
Two special events occurred on the last day. We had all brought gifts, many handcrafted, that represented our region or country and they were placed on a blanket at the front of the room. Then everyone was invited to select one of the gifts. </p><p>
After lunch we planted an evergreen tree on the grounds of the centre as a lasting reminder of the Sacred Circle. We had all been asked to bring samples of soil and water from home. After prayers, the soil and water were blessed and used in planting the tree. </p><p>
To be part of the Sacred Circle was an extremely satisfying experience. I hope that we as a diocese will give serious consideration to finding ways in which we can be partners with the Indigenous people. Personal encounters will help and a start has been made in this direction. Grace Delaney, from Moose Factory, a member of the Anglican Council of Indigenous people and the Council of General Synod has been invited to Synod and will take part in one of the workshops. </p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Links" -->
