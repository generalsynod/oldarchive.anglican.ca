      Many lasting memories fill my mind of Sacred Circle 2000 - Walking A New Vision. I will try to convey but a few to our readers. Excitement began many months prior as Huron L.A.I.C., the Native council of Huron, prepared to host this gathering. The canvas &quot;care bags&quot; lovingly prepared by several A.C.W. groups in our Diocese were filled with wonderful books and materials. One of my greatest delights was meeting Elder Millie Michel from Litton, B.C. who still had the energy to muster a weary smile upon her midnight arrival. Participants from all over Canada felt refreshed in the peaceful, hospitable setting the C.A.W. Center provided.

The opening procession with the sounds of drum, traditional singer and the smell of sweet grass meant so much to so many. Lay people, clergy and bishops in traditional dress lead the way for Primate Michael Peers, proudly wearing his exquisite Nishga honor blanket. The Primate shared the gift of his adoption into the Nishga nation through his naming ceremony and vestment to be worn in trust as a caregiver of the nations. </p><p>
Bishop Paul Idlout (Arctic) shared much love and wisdom in his homily. He thanked God for the music of the flute that was a gift from our own Eileen Scully. He recalled a time when the sound of the flute evoked another very beautiful gift of love from the creator to his ears. His smile spoke a million words. </p><p>
Bishop Andrew Atagotaaluk (Arctic) reassured us by affirming that it is okay to go back in our history as it helps reveal how our thinking/or biases were formed. Sometimes the going back is necessary before we can go forward. </p><p>
Bishop Arthur Malcolm, (Queensland, Australia) shared hope for our healing and the reconciliation journey of the whole church. Our stories are continents apart but so sadly similar in many other ways. </p><p>
The gift of hope was evident through the voices of our youth and homilist Gabriel Constant. The youth had requested special blessing and prayers for strength, wisdom and guidance. The gift of the laying on of hands from their regional clergy and bishops will have a lasting impact on their young lives. Youth also asked delegates in their circles to name a word (s) that hold power over them to cause pain and write it/them on a piece of paper (i.e. fat, ugly, useless). The papers were collected as an offertory during the Thursday service and burned. The ashes were placed in the earth of the tree that was planted to commemorate the Sacred Circle. </p><p>
The days began early (7:30) and ended late (2 or 3:00 am) but still there did not seem to be enough time to talk to everyone. Every conversation was so meaningful and left me with even more questions and excitement. Of course there was always energy enough after our daily circle wrap ups/reflection to sing joyous praises to our Lord. </p><p>
Our circle shared tremendous trust, truth and tears. We named many problems that we encounter in our troubled communities: alcohol, drugs, chemical/sexual/physical abuse, suicide, neglecting our children, anger, denial, divorce/adultery/separation of family, high unemployment, blaming others, loss of language, racism, discrimination, divisions by people in power in our community (nepotism), mean spirited gossip, comments that bring about loss of confidence, lack of respect to elders and children or each other. The impact of all these issues can be overwhelming for even the strongest individual. </p><p>
We can only respond from where are right now in our own healing journey. We need to step beyond where we may be locked in time, learn from our history of life experience and move on confidently to educate and nurture others. We agreed we could only take responsibility for mistakes on our parts. Only we can forgive ourselves before we are able to forgive others. We need help because we have admitted we can't do it by ourselves. With the grace of God leading us onward we see a renewed vision of hope. There is much work to be done in every community across Canada in order for us to live out our Covenant promise. </p><p>
Resolutions to support Huron LAIC educational goals were drafted long before the residential school lawsuits surfaced in our Diocese. The partnership vision will continue, &quot;as long as the grace of God guides us, as long as the sun rises, the river flows, and the grass grows&quot;. </p><p>
I would love very much to be invited to bring the message of JUBILEE III to area deaneries in the near future as part of our education initiative. </p><p>
