    <div align="center"><em>By Laverne Jacobs, Walpole Island First Nation <br />
  Reprinted from Huron Church News </em></div>
    When the missionaries landed on this land of Turtle Island the First Peoples recognized the Truth the missionaries talked about. They accepted Jesus because in many ways they already knew him. However, the missionaries also brought a way of life which meant the demise of a People. Native languages, cultural ways and spirituality were discouraged and in many cases forbidden. The effect of this form of oppression meant the destruction of the soul of a People. </p><p>
This devastation was graphically portrayed at the first Native Convocation held in 1988 at Fort Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan. After the community of First Nations Anglicans shared stories of pain, alienation and loss Rose Evans, from Norway House shared a dream she had during the night: </p><p>
I saw a beautiful feather coming out of the sky... and I didn't want it to touch the ground. I was going to catch it... And all of a sudden it was pulled up. My people were trying to get the feather and they were trying to reach the feather, but others were controlling it. The people wanted the feather so much because it meant so much to them. Everything is sacred to them. The feather was symbolic of the dream of my people to stand together, to help each other, to pray for each other and to have strength.... </p><p>
Rose's dream confirmed the innate desire of a people: the hope and dream to be whole; to be the people the Creator intended them to be. This first Convocation with the theme of &quot;Share the Dream&quot; was a Pentecostal experience empowering First Nations Anglicans to return to their dioceses determined to work toward the fulfillment of that dream. </p><p>
A second gathering was held in the summer of 1993 at Minaki, Ontario in the Diocese of Keewatin. This Convocation had the theme of &quot;Dancing the Dream&quot;. But before the dance could begin, people had to deal with the pain and trauma of residential schools. One elder yelled through his tears: &quot;I want to hear the apology of the Anglican Church of Canada. I'm not afraid.... I'll never be afraid to talk to a White man.&quot; After almost three days of unburdening their pain and weeping the community gathered for a healing service. Moments before the healing service began, the Primate asked permission to speak: &quot;...Together here with you I have listened as you have told your stories... I accept and I confess, before God and you, our failures in the residential schools. We failed you. ...On behalf of the Anglican Church of Canada, I present our apology....&quot; </p><p>
A profound silence filled the room as people tried to understand what this action meant. Then there was the sound of weeping around the room as the impact of the apology began to sink in. &quot;When I heard the apology, I couldn't stop crying.&quot; The healing could now begin. Though some have difficulty accepting the apology, others are slowly gathering to dance. &quot;I think that today we can start dancing the dream&quot; &quot;It's going to take a few more years for forgiveness to happen. The Elders must listen well, with respect. But we have to pray about it, because if we pray for anyone, I know it works.&quot; In time the community will be able to sing with the Psalmist: &quot;You have turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy, that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give you thanks for ever.&quot; [Psalm 30: 11, 12] </p><p>
The community gathered a third time in 1997 at Lethbridge, Alberta with the theme of &quot;Our Journey of Spiritual Renewal&quot;. It was time for First Nations Anglicans to reflect on their relationship with the Creator and the Church. In March, 1994 First Nations leaders covenanted among themselves: &quot;...Under the guidance of God's Spirit we agree to do all we can to call our People into unity in a new, self-determining community within the Anglican Church of Canada. To this end, we extend the hand of partnership to all those who will help us build a truly Anglican Indigenous Church in Canada. May God bless this new vision and give us grace to accomplish it. Amen.&quot; </p><p>
This community pondered and wrestled with the implications of the Native Covenant.
</p><blockquote> &quot;The covenant is a personal commitment and it grows. When the Holy Spirit works with us as a people, we will know this is a new church; a church of life, one that holds life for generations to come.&quot; </p><p>
&quot;As I listened here, we need unity, we need to work together as Anglicans. I've met a lot of good Christian people here, and when I say my prayers, I will always think of you. This covenant-get a hold of it. God will lead you in the way you should go.&quot; </p><p>
&quot;I felt that as a partner, it means to take the time to listen. To sign the covenant as a partner is to affirm a particular way of working together.&quot; </p></blockquote>
The fourth gathering, Anglican Indigenous Sacred Circle 2000, assembled at Port Elgin in the Diocese of Huron. The theme &quot;Walking A New Vision&quot; captured the movement of the people. &quot;There is a sense of growth. The community has grown beyond where it was before. The community has a new sense of confidence. There seems to be a new determination to move forward. ...This one, the sense of electricity, almost, in the air. As people talk, things happen. It's like people are ready to move into the future. I think that there is a new vision, a transforming vision....&quot; </p><p>
It has been a joy to see the Creator rekindle the spirit of a people. Watching this growth has been like watching the blossoming of a delicate and fragrant flower whose beauty and fragrance will surely touch those around them. This Journey of Spiritual Renewal continues. &quot;As First Nations of this land, we are a people of hope and vision, and that vision will become clearer the more we gather together.&quot; </p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Links" -->
