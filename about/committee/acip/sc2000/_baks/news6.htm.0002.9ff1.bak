    <div align="center"><em>By Murray Still <br />
  Reprinted from Rupert's Land News </em></div>
    Indigenous Anglicans head into the 21st century with a new sense of hoped fuelled by their latest national gathering August 18 to 25. </p><p>
&quot;At this (Sacred Circle), there is a sense of electricity, almost, in the air,&quot; stated one of the members. &quot;As people talk, things happen. It's like people are ready to move into the future. I think there is a new vision, a transforming vision. It's just like something new and exciting is happening here.&quot; </p><p>
A total of 97 people registered to attend the Anglican Indigenous Sacred Circle, including several indigenous clergy. In addition the Primate, seven non indigenous partners, five bishops, 14 members of the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP), two international partners, six staff and three media people swelled the total attendance to 135. </p><p>
The opening worship service of the Sacred Circle featured the beat of the drum, and a chant led by the Rev. Mervin Wolfleg. In his opening remarks, Anglican Primate Michael Peers reflected on the theme of unity as described by Jesus in chapter 17 of John's gospel. &quot;(Jesus) prayed for unity because his followers were not one. Division was very real among his disciples.&quot; </p><p>
The Primate explained it is easy to be one when we are all the same, but to go to all nations means to pray constantly that we may all be one. Being one is not easy, it takes a lot of work, he noted. </p><p>
Further recounting Christ's struggles in the Garden of Gethsemane, Peers reminded the members of the Sacred Circle that God would always provide the challenges. However, he also provides the power and authority to meet the challenge. Along with the challenge and the will of God comes the support and will which are of God. The Primate explained that we could challenge one another because essentially we support one another. </p><p>
Challenge and support are the two aspects that showed up clearly during the Sacred Circle. The event was surrounded in prayer, worship, Bible study and fellowship. Each morning, during the worship, one of the five bishops delivered a major sermon. Members of the Sacred Circle then broke into small &quot;talking circles&quot; to reflect on the challenges raised. Each small circle enjoyed the support of a facilitator and counselor. </p><p>
Following mid day prayers and lunch, small groups met to discuss the issues facing indigenous peoples-abuse in residential schools, attempts at healing and reconciliation and ways of living the national native Covenant. </p><p>
The national Native Covenant was drafted in Winnipeg in 1994 and calls indigenous Anglicans to work toward self determination within the Anglican Church of Canada. </p><p>
Each small group was given the same set of questions to reflect on. For example, some of the questions raised included:
</p><blockquote> &quot;What does the national native Covenant mean to us and to our communities?&quot; &quot;How can we overcome the past?&quot; </p><p>
&quot;What are you going to do about reconciliation in your community?&quot; </p><p>
&quot;What do you need to gather strength in your community for the journey?&quot; </p></blockquote>
</p><p>
Each day, members from various provinces from around Canada led the morning and evening worship. Manitoba's group consisted of members from the Dioceses of Brandon, Rupert's Land and Keewatin. The Manitoba group led the Wednesday worship that featured a sweet grass ceremony led by elder Gladys Cook. </p><p>
In a special service led by the young people, members were directed to write down statements that were demoralizing and dehumanizing, such as &quot;You are lazy.&quot; The statements were collected and burned as part of the confessional time. At the end of the liturgy, the clergy in attendance came to the front, laid hands on the youth and blessed them. Later in the week, members experienced a service of Divine Healing. </p><p>
&quot;For me, the healing service really stands out, just because I've never been to anything like that. I've never experienced that before,&quot; noted one of the Sacred Circle &quot;Memory Keepers,' people who came together at the end of each day to reflect on the day's events. </p><p>
On the last day of the Sacred Circle, an evergreen tree was planted near the main assembly hall. Members of the Sacred Circle had brought water and earth from their home communities. Both the water and earth were blessed and added to the ground where the tree was planted. The tree will act as a reminder of the unity achieved at the Sacred Circle and the community's pledge to continue to work toward healing and reconciliation. </p><p>
In his closing remarks, the Primate challenged young people to continue the work of mission. To do so, they will need to be able to offer the invitation to their peers, and ensure there is a loving and supportive community in place to receive the ones who have been invited. </p><p>
This Sacred Circle was the fourth such gathering of indigenous Anglicans. Three others were held in Fort Qu'Appelle, Minaki, Ontario and Lethbridge, Alberta. It was during the national gathering at Minaki Lodge that the Primate first issued an apology on behalf of the Anglican Church of Canada to all indigenous Anglicans affected by the damages done at Residential Schools. </p><p>
Indigenous Anglicans praised the efforts of the Primate with a standing ovation during one of the services of worship. </p><p>
&quot;As the head of the Anglican Church of Canada, you are the instrument God has chosen to orchestrate the Church to start over, after admitting to the wrongs that your ancestors have committed,&quot; said Saskatoon elder Ethel Ahenakew. &quot;We can now start building bridges so that white and aboriginal people can come together and become strong as a church, a church where you have laid a strong foundation with your apology.&quot; </p><p>
Members of the Rupert's Land Indigenous Council (RIL) in attendance included the Rev. Barry and Freda Bear, the Rev. Barbara Shoomski, elder Gladys Cook and the Rev. Murray Still. The RIL has met once since returning from the Sacred Circle, and pledges to continue the work of healing and reconciliation in the diocese. </p><!-- InstanceEndEditable --><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Links" -->
