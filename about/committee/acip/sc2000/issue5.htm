    <h3>The Long Haul</h3>
    Archbishop Michael Peers in his closing address at the Anglican Indigenous Sacred Circle set out to do three things: 1) give a personal reflection 2) say a word to the young people and 3) reflect on the Scripture. </p><p>
Peers commented on the four convocations. Each were different in setting, purpose and outcomes. He has seen things that happen in the long haul. Such things are experiences of pain--pain about the schools, communities, churches, our own lives and friends' lives. He has heard stories of change, healing, forgiveness and reconciliation. The proportion of these stories is increasing. </p><p>
He expressed his gratitude for the generous references to the apology which put a personal face to the voice. Native appreciation of the apology is encouraging and affirming in the face of those who do not support and will never support the apology. To hear affirmation from the people who received it is very important. </p><p>
Peers then addressed the youth relating his own experience of being invited to church by someone his own age. He challenged the youth to invite someone to church with them. Moreover he challenged the adults to make church an inviting community. </p><p>
In his reflection on John 15 the Primate points out that Jesus calls us friends. Thus in the midst of all the turmoil we have a friend. In the midst of that is less than great there is a friend.
</p><h4>Our Partners Speak</h4>
On the afternoon of the final day of the Sacred Circle Partners shared their reflections with the delegates. </p><p>
In introducing their presentation Brian Pearson thanked the Circle for inviting them into the circle to be present and be themselves. He said their role as partners was to be among the native community and watch what the Spirit was doing in their midst. </p><p>
Anxiety prior to the gathering was common . There was fear of acting inappropriately. There was concern about how one might be perceived. </p><p>
Partners stated unanimously that their experience in the Circle was an enormous privilege and a tremendous honour. </p><p>
The Circle, for some, was a welcoming place, a truly Sacred circle of healing. For others it has been a place of transformation. &quot;I feel as if the scales have been removed from my eyes.&quot;</p><p>
Some have commented on the honesty, openness, and respect which they observed in the circle. Most have found the stories and pain of the residential schools overwhelming. Yet the response to this trauma has been a remarkable journey marked by faith, strength and the determination to heal and move ahead. </p><p>
The Partners' open and honest sharing was a wonderful and deeply appreciated gift to the Circle.
</p><h3>Tree Planted to Commemorate Circle</h3>
A blue spruce tree was planted on the CAW grounds to commemorate the Fourth Anglican Indigenous Sacred Circle. </p><p>
Delegates to the Sacred Circle gathered outside near the Children's Centre to plant the spruce. Representatives from the four directions said a prayer in the appropriate direction. Members than placed earth and water from their home around the tree. A final prayer of blessing was said by Mervin Wolfleg. </p><p>
After the planting Linda, of CAW thanked the Circle for the tree saying they would look after it. </p><p>
The tree planting was the highlight of the day for many people. </p><p>
&quot;For me the highlight of the day was the planting of the tree. The blessing of it was just a very powerful and emotional moment for me.&quot;</p><p>
&quot;The highlight of the day for me was the planting of the tree. It had a spiritual significance for me. </p><p>
Jesus is the vine; we are the branches. We have to keep pruning the tree. People felt some strong spiritual movement there.&quot;</p><p>
&quot;The highlight of the day for me was the planting of the tree, because we all did it together in the four directions&quot;</p><p>
&quot;I felt that we were all one. The CAW saying that they would take care of our tree closed it for me.&quot;
</p><h4>Having Fun</h4>
&quot;The other thing the people got dancing. Funny. People were playing musical chairs. In the midst of all the pain, the elders have a great sense of humour and have lots of fun. And tonight they're all excited about the dance. They keep going. Such endurance. People ask how can you still forgive when you have so much hurt, and so much pain? I believe it's their spiritual faith that gives them the strength to go on. This is what the people used to do. They'd have fun. Nice to see even the men participating. We pulled them out last night. We were really encouraged . The aboriginal bishops touched us because they spoke from the heart. Every time you sit and talk with them , they remind you over and over again how important it is to do God's work with honesty, love, and respect. Until you do that nobody's going to change. </p><p>
Spent a lot of time with them. Bp Paul sitting in the service alone. Invited to sit between them people respond to that. Become a family. </p><p>
Moved his chair between us so he's not so lonely.&quot;
</p><h4>Next Circle Needs To Focus On the Young</h4>
There is some concern for the youth. &quot;
Young people still more space. We want them to be here. We say we value them, but I'm not sure we include them in the planning process. We need to ask them how they want to be included. It's wonderful to have them come in and lead worship but it's almost a token thing </p><p>
Where I work, it's made up of young people who come from all across the country. They have had to leave for reasons of abuse or because they feel unsafe at home; they're two-spirited. They feel they no longer fit any more. I think sometimes communities back home are failing them. I'm not convinced all of the suicides are about abuse or rejection </p><p>
The next circle needs to focus on young people.&quot;<br />
