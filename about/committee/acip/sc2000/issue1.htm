    <h3>That is hard!</h3>
    So says Primate Michael Peers of the call to unity in his address at the opening service of the 4th gathering of Native Anglicans, The Sacred Indigenous Circle 2000. </p><p>
Peers opened his homily by introducing himself and explaining his name and the significance of the Nishga blanket he wore. Unlike other Nishga blankets this blanket given to him upon his adoption as a Nishga bore symbols of four clans. The inclusion of all four clans emphasizes the role of his office and that of the church as an instrument of unity -unifying and bringing together all the clans and tribes. </p><p>
In his reflections on John 17 Peers points out that Jesus prayed that his followers all be one. He prayed for unity because his followers were not one. Division was very real among his disciples. </p><p>
Peers also drew attention to Jesus' final words in the gospel of Matthew: &quot;Go ? make disciples of all nations?&quot; Peers believes Christ's prayer for unity gives us the mandate to include all nations, all cultures, all tribes. It is easy to be one when we are the same, but to go to all nations means to pray constantly that we may all be one. Being one is not easy-it takes a lot of work. </p><p>
Recounting Christ's struggle in the Garden Peers reminds us God will always provide the challenges. But He also provides the power and authority to meet the challenge. Along with the challenge and the will of God come the support and will which are of God. Peers believes that we can challenge one another because essentially we support one another. </p><p>
We are the community called into one-challenged by diversity, assured by the power of God and presence of Jesus as we remain in Jesus.
</p><h4>The Call of the Drum</h4>
The opening worship service of the Anglican Indigenous Sacred Circle 2000 evoked high praise from the Keepers of the Memory. Keepers expressed appreciation for the integration of cultural elements in the service. </p><p>
The Drum and Chant called worshipers into the presence of the Creator as the procession of bishops and celebrant began. The procession was led by singer Mervin Wolfleg and Elder Mary Sturgeon who blessed the room and gathering with sweetgrass. After smudging the room and drummer, celebrant and Primate, she welcomed the people to Algonquian territory and prayed for the gathering. Throughout the service Native images and forms were used.
</p><h4>This One's Different</h4>
People who were at previous gatherings of First Nations? Anglicans reported sensing a different mood at this gathering. There is a sense of growth. The community has grown beyond where it was before. The community has a new sense of confidence. There seems to be a new determination to move forward. </p><p>
&quot;A lot of things happened today. I think just the mood of the day. I think this is going to be a very different circle than any of the other three before. The sense I have was that, and I was only at the last one. The first one was just an initial gathering. Indigenous First Nations Anglicans coming together. It was the first time it ever happened. The second was a heavy one, sharing the pain, telling dreadful stories of what happened, largely in residential schools. The third one was focused around the Covenant . This one, the sense of electricity, almost, in the air. As people talk, things happen. It's like people are ready to move into the future. I think that there is a new vision, a transforming vision. That's impression I get. Everything is happening. It's just like something new and exciting is happening here.
</p><h4>Circles and Community</h4>
The Sharing Circles are really appreciated. It was noted how quickly a trusting community has been established in some circles. </p><p>
?Regarding the circles. It's the mixture of people that are there. They differ. People are not in the same diocese or nearby each other. But there's quite a mixture when you have youth, elders and middle-age people. And there's lot of openness in the circles. And people came here to share and to exchange information with each other. </p><p>
And for the ? since the beginning when we left Toronto from the airport, people were hugging each other, talking to each other, you know. In the bus the people were laughing. It's a long drive though, about three hours.?
</p><h4>Anglican Video</h4>
So you want to be a movie star. Well, now's your chance. </p><p>
Award-winning Anglican Video is with us once again. Over the years Anglican Video has been most helpful in enabling First Nations Anglican to tell their story. Through the gifts of Anglican video we have been able to foster greater understanding and change attitudes in the church. </p><p>
During this Sacred Circle Lisa, Irving and Becky will be filming throughout the gathering to help us tell more of our story. </p><p>
Please welcome them. And when the visit your circle please welcome them. They are our friends with a genuine desire to help us. </p><p>
If you really feel uncomfortable sharing in their presence. Tell them kindly, and they will turn the cameras of during your sharing. However, the more we can share openly with them present, the more understanding and healing we can foster in our church and communities.<br />
</p>
<h4>Happy Birthday to:</h4>
Gladys Cook and Mervin Wolfleg </p><p>
How old is Mervin anyway? Sometimes he says he's 16. Sometimes he says he's 39. But he dropped a little hint the other day saying: &quot;In 1954 when I was 8 years old...&quot;
