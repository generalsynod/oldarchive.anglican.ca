<p><strong>Report to the meeting of General Synod<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>June 2010</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>The Organization</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<p>PWRDF is an instrument of faith for Anglicans in Canada who pray, act and give to fulfill the vision of a truly just, healthy, and peaceful world.  PWRDF changes lives and changes communities as the Anglican Church of Canada’s official agency for development, relief, refugee response and global justice.  PWRDF has 50 years of results in relief response, transformational development, and development education.</p>
<p>Partnership is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">way</span> of working for PWRDF and it is also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span> work of PWRDF.  This reality is at the core of PWRDF and at the nucleus of the way forward.</p>
<p>PWRDF’s excels at</p>
<ul>
<li>rapid response to humanitarian disasters</li>
<li>solid development partnerships delivering integrated programs and building capacity</li>
<li>development focused on community aspirations</li>
<li>parish-based development education programs</li>
<li>developing local leaders for the Anglican Church of Canada</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>The People of PWRDF are its strength</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<p>Within the organisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partners in development and relief programs around the world (99 projects in 25 countries, including Canada) and partners in the public engagement program within the Anglican Church of Canada keep the program grounded in the local context and enliven PWRDF by sharing their knowledge and discoveries.</li>
<li>Development and relief partners engage with PWRDF in program planning, monitoring and evaluation and as a result of three recent roundtables are further engaged in a dynamic dialogue about our shared work.</li>
<li>Locally based volunteers find their way to PWRDF through a number of processes:
<ul>
<li>Diocesan bishops appoint marvellous PWRDF Diocesan representatives and coordinators and refugee coordinators.</li>
<li>Provincial Metropolitans appoint engaged members to the youth council.</li>
<li>PWRDF Parish representatives are appointed or chosen locally and provided a broader network of engaged, committed PWRDF volunteers and supporters.</li>
<li>These individual ministries and the support they receive from bishops and diocese build connections and collaboration across the church that will achieve the PWRDF 50th Anniversary awareness raising goal. We give thanks for these volunteers who bring PWRDF to life for Anglicans across Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our multi-lingual staff brings experience from around the world, from non-profit, government and corporate sectors, and applies education and experience in development program methodologies, humanitarian response, adult education, and refugee policy and programme.  PWRDF has experienced both the addition and loss of staff over the past three years to meet strategic plan objectives and to accommodate other organisational needs. We give thanks to all who have served on the staff of PWRDF over the past three years as they provided their passion, skills and expertise to partners, volunteers and one another. Most recently PWRDF has experienced a staff restructuring which has resulted in a new two team structure with a smaller staff complement. In addition to this Cheryl Curtis left her position as PWRDF Executive Director at the end of February.  Adele Finney began as interim Executive Director on March 29. This is a process that PWRDF will move through with the guidance of Adele. The current staff are:
<ul>
<li>Interim Executive Director, Adele Finney</li>
<li>Executive Assistant, Janet Donnelly</li>
<li>Communications Coordinator, Simon Chambers</li>
<li>Finance and Administrative Team
<ul>
<li>Jill Martin, Manager</li>
<li>Annie Au-Yeung, Administrative Associate</li>
<li>Ricky de Castro, Grants Administrative Associate</li>
<li>Alice Locquiao, Systems Facilitator</li>
<li>Program Team
<ul>
<li>Elsa Tesfay, Manager</li>
<li>Zaida Bastos, CIDA Coordinator</li>
<li>Mahjabeen Chowdhury, Asia-Pacific Coordinator</li>
<li>Naba Gurung, Humanitarian Response Coordinator</li>
<li>Christine Hills, Public Engagement Network Officer</li>
<li>Jeannethe Lara, Africa Coordinator</li>
<li>Suzanne Rumsey, Public Engagement Coordinator</li>
<li>Carolyn Vanderlip, 50th Anniversary Program Coordinator (to 07/10)</li>
<li>Jose Zarate, Latin America/Caribbean and Indigenous Peoples Development Coordinator</li>
<li><em>just</em>generation.ca Facilitator (vacant—to be filled by April 2010)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our board works in a policy governance model with elected board members from across our church and representing partnerships in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America-Caribbean, Indigenous Communities in Canada and Canadian ecumenical  partners.  Their leadership and ambassadorship moves PWRDF towards its goals. We are blessed with the leadership of the primate, Archbishop Fred Hiltz, who is spending his first triennium serving as president of the PWRDF board of directors and setting a shining example of ambassadorship for God’s mission in the world through PWRDF.  Specifically the current board members are:
<ul>
<li>The Most Reverend Frederick J. Hiltz President</li>
<li>The Reverend David Pritchard  Vice President (Yukon)</li>
<li>Mr. Jim Cullen     Treasurer (Toronto)</li>
<li>The Reverend Laura Marie Piotrowicz- Secretary (Brandon)</li>
<li>Mr. Chris Longson   Chair Development Standing Committee (Calgary)</li>
<li>The Reverend Lynn C. Ross  Chair Public Engagement Standing Committee (Quebec)</li>
<li>Mr. Eric Traficante   Youth Council Liaison (Algoma)</li>
<li>Ms. Farida Akhter   International Partner – Asia-Pacific</li>
<li>Ms. Vivian Ayoungman   Diocese of Calgary</li>
<li>Ms. Donna Goodleaf   Indigenous Partner</li>
<li>Mr. Matt Koovisk    Diocese of Kootney</li>
<li>Mrs. Maureen Lawrence   Diocese of British Columbia</li>
<li>The Right Reverend Tom Morgan  Diocese of Saskatoon</li>
<li>Ms. Judy Oatway    Diocese of Montreal</li>
<li>Mr. William Ogara   International Partner &#8211; Africa</li>
<li>The Right Reverend Philip Poole  Diocese of Toronto</li>
<li>Rafael Soares de Oliveira   International Partner – Latin America</li>
<li>Mrs. Lynne Taylor   Diocese of Nova Scotia &amp; PEI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Board of Directors meets twice a year for three days of meetings in the spring and fall. The fall meetings include an annual general meeting. The Executive Committee meets approximately monthly throughout the year making decisions on behalf of the Board of Directors or preparing work for decision by the whole board.</p>
<ul>
<li>We give thanks to two patrons for supporting our 50th Anniversary Program
<ul>
<li>Lynne Samways-Hiltz who has embraced the role of patron of the 50th Anniversary program with a particular focus on the 50 Leaders project, PWRDF’s gift to our church;  and</li>
<li>Madame Adrienne Clarkson as patron of the 50 Refugees project which highlights the radical hospitality and justice ministry of refugee sponsorship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside the organization</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to sharing physical space with The Anglican Church of Canada we share the Primate and the Church itself. We give thanks for Archbishop Hiltz strong voice as an ambassador for PWRDF that has inspired and encouraged many others in raising their voice in prayer and action in support of PWRDF partner work. We also give thanks for the parish treasurers and donors across the country who faithfully provide the funds that enable much of the work to happen.</li>
<li>PWRDF participates in the General Synod and the Council of General Synod with a voice but not a vote. A board member is appointed to the three-year term as representative of CoGS. The Executive Director is a member of the Leadership Circle of Church House.</li>
<li>PWRDF has had regular access to the House of Bishops to share stories of our shared ministry and seek input on directions for PWRDF regarding branding and other initiatives.</li>
<li>Within Church House we deeply value opportunities for collaborative work with colleagues in Indigenous Ministries, Information Resources, The Partnerships Department and The Department of Philanthropy. Activities of note have included collaboration on the 2008 Millennium Development Goal walk in Ottawa and the Acts of Faith Gift Guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Union</p>
<ul>
<li>In February of 2008 a vote by staff was held that led to the creation of a local of The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) at PWRDF. Bargaining for the first collective agreement began later that year and the agreement was ratified effective November 16th 2010 and expires March 31, 2011.</li>
<li>Both staff and management rights have been articulated in this collective agreement and have led to new ways of operating and communicating that will both change and strengthen the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Programme and administration</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<p>Strategic Plan</p>
<p>For the past three years PWRDF has engaged in a learning review process which is equipping PWRDF to meet the challenges of the next decade (2010–2020), strengthened in its tradition as an innovative and strong partner in its work on development, relief, refugees and global justice at the local and global levels.  A strategic framework of 11 objectives guided the activities and achievements of PWRDF and are reflected in the body of this report. A new strategic plan will be approved later this year or early in the next year.</p>
<p>The intended impact of all work undertaken during this strategic period (2007-2010) is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>PWRDF will improve its capacity to plan for and communicate results,</li>
<li>PWRDF will continue to develop leaders for the whole Anglican Church of Canada,</li>
<li>PWRDF will be an enlivening participant in the Anglican Communion in a time when mission is strengthening what theological debate is sometimes fracturing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Development, Relief and Refugees</p>
<ul>
<li>The core work for the development team is the ongoing accompaniment of partners around the world. The planning, monitoring and evaluation methods have been strengthened and systematized through both staff and partner input and implementation. We continue to accompany long-term partners, have ended or re-shaped a small number of partnerships and entered into some new relationships in the past three years.</li>
<li>A new focus for the development team was the holding of three regional roundtables with a fourth one to happen in 2011  within the Indigenous Development Program. These roundtables brought together local partners in Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America to discuss their work and the ways in which PWRDF participates in the transformation that they are able to effect in their communities. It was a time of learning and sharing that enabled PWRDF board members and network volunteers to meet partners and share their experiences of PWRDF in Canada as well as hear from partners about their work. Partners invited visitors to visit local projects and these visits led to many, many presentations and actions back home raising awareness and educating Anglicans in Canada.</li>
<li>Although the tsunami happened on December 26, 2004 PWRDF’s work with partners continued through most of this triennium, wrapping up in spring of 2009. PWRDF partnered with other Canadian denominations and The Canadian Development Agency (CIDA) to provide 6 million dollars that built houses, provided fishing equipment and boats to fishing cooperatives, and enabled women to develop new income generating skills to support the family. The experience of this shared work and a subsequent shared response to the South Asia earthquake in 2005 led to the creation of Canadian Churches in Action (CCA).</li>
<li>Relief work continues to be part of the work with an earthquake in China and cyclone in Burma in 2008 and the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile. Our ability to work ecumenically through CCA and to be visible in the Canadian media continues to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finance</p>
<ul>
<li>Of concern in this economic climate, especially to those organizations that have contingency reserve funds with stock market exposure, is the status of those portfolios.  The PWRDF Investment Policy, which directed the PWRDF portfolio towards balanced conservative management, has weathered the market meltdown well to date.  Endowment funds and the cash investment account are continuing to experience positive income returns.</li>
<li>The tsunami (December 2004), South Asia earthquake (October 2005), the China earthquake (June 2008) and the cyclone in Burma (May 2008), where governments around the world announced matching government funds to those emergencies, resulted in oversubscribed appeals.  Many relief organizations reserve the right, should this situation occur, to re-direct designated funds towards emergencies of greatest need and allocate a percentage towards administration.  The response to the recent earthquake in Haiti in which PWRDF received donations totalling just over $2million highlights this issue once again as significant organizational resources have been completely or partially redirected to the processing of over 30,000 individual donations. Currently PWRDF uses all relief funds for the relief work and covers the administrative costs from regular operating funds.</li>
<li>With the growing use of Canada Helps to make on-line donations, we observe an emerging trend in anonymous gifts.  In 2008, this revenue accounted for one percent of all donor support and represented sizable gifts. It was a significant source of funds in response to the Haiti earthquake as well.</li>
<li>Gifts of securities have understandably fallen off.  For estates in probate, where the death of the giftor preceded the stock market crash, there is the issue of receipting an estate for the original value, while receiving a substantially depreciated stock.  PWRDF had one such direct experience, but as many estates are actually handled at the parish or diocesan level, it is not possible to judge whether this will have a significant impact.</li>
<li>PWRDF continues to receive generous bequests from committed donors and thanks the planned giving officers and consultants across the country for their work that nurtures these gifts. While 4% is the Canadian average ratio for bequests to total revenue, PWRDF continues to receive over 10% of its revenue annually from bequests.  PWRDF continues to budget conservatively for bequests and directs them to the operating budget, but will examine this practice with a view to establishing a revised bequest policy.</li>
<li>Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) funds 1.2 million dollars of our current program located in Mozambique, Tanzania, Burundi, and Bangladesh with a focus on primary and preventive health care. We are in the last year of a three year agreement which ends in December 2011. This agreement continues our 36 year history with CIDA, but was a significant narrowing and focussing of the program with fewer partners. This change results from the need to re-submit our program proposal following an initial refusal of funds in February 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public Engagement and Communications</p>
<ul>
<li>Public engagement continues to produce resources and support volunteers across the country in their local ministries as they pray, act, and give in support of PWRDF. The creativity and persistence of parishes small and large to make a difference in the world through PWRDF is awe-inspiring and we give thanks. Local workshops, regional meetings and two national gatherings are key moments in the cycle of education and information distribution.</li>
<li>We see evidence that PWRDF leaders are a gift to the church and it is a particular point of investment through the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary 50 Leaders program.  Ten youth and young adults from the Arctic to the Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island start their orientation for the first program in November 2009.A summer 2010 vacation bible school will be at least one gift to the church from this program. A new group of leaders will be chosen for the program in September 2010.</li>
<li>Likewise the church continues to gift PWRDF with key volunteers. In 2009 the Youth Council nomination committee had a surplus of interested candidates and employed a screening process to come up with our current council. Council members are:  Maureen Bailey, British Columbia/ Yukon; Melissa Green, APCI; Jennifer Andreas, Qu’Appelle; Matthew Terlinski, Rupert’s Land; Chris Miller, Student Christian Movement; Heather Pearson, Niagara; Beth Lorimer, Ottawa; Katilyn Duthie-Kannikkatt, Catholic Organization of Development and Peace ; Eric Traficante, Niagara; Kathy Ashford-Smith, ELCIC; Cydney Proctor, Nova Scotia and PEI; Maïda Vandendorpe, Montreal; Aaron Emery, Toronto; ACIP (Vacant); Laura Marie Piotrowicz, PWRDF Board (Observer).</li>
<li>February 2009 saw PWRDF staff and volunteers travel to Burundi in response to a partner request to develop a youth focussed relationship with the Diocese of Burundi. That was followed by a visit of their youth staff Edmond Bayisabe, who travelled to Calgary, Edmonton, and Toronto during his stay in October 2009. We plan to continue this relationship with further visits and other contacts.</li>
<li>The 50th Anniversary program was a focus for the Public Engagement team in many ways and is highlighted below.</li>
<li>PWRDF communications have been intensified: <em>Learning from Partners </em>DVD series has been launched; Under the Sun newsletter now appears in a newspaper format as an insert in the Anglican Journal reaching over 180,000 people, and the three websites: <em>pwrdf.org</em> the main website; <em>pwrdf50.org</em>, the website for the 50th Anniversary and <em>justgeneration.ca</em>, the website for youth,  offer increasing levels of interactivity. As part of our response to Haiti the website now features a weekly parish pew bulletin insert that is also distributed via email.</li>
<li>The participatory branding process was an organizational task led by the communications team and is described below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Initiatives</p>
<p>50th Anniversary Program</p>
<ul>
<li>October 2008 launched PWRDF’s 50th anniversary program with a visit to Springhill, Nova Scotia to commemorate the mining disaster of October 23, 1958. An extensive program of resources and activities has taken place over the last eighteen months including the marking of September 7, 1959 as the official creation date of The Primate’s World Relief Fund.</li>
<li>The goals of celebration, — awareness, fundraising, and education — have been worked towards through local and regional events, new children’s resources, fundraising dinners, One Voice CD sales, and many other activities.</li>
<li>The 50 Refugees Sponsorship initiatives have surpassed the half-way mark with many more sponsorships in process. New Anglican and ecumenical communities have welcomed refugees  for the first time and old hands have strengthened their capacity to do this work through the support and seed funding of PWRDF.</li>
<li>The PWRDF 50th Anniversary program will come to a close at the General Synod meeting in Halifax with reflections on our fifty years, stories of transformation and inspiration for the next fifty. In the meantime, parishes are singing the new hymn, praying the prayer of remembrance for the Springhill mine disaster, welcoming refugees, supporting new leaders, using Sunday School curriculum, and raising funds using the <em>Cookies to Champagne</em> awareness and fund-raising kit.</li>
<li>This program was led by contract staff Carolyn Vanderlip who will wrap up her work in July and a diverse group of volunteers on the 50th Anniversary Steering Committee. Thanks to all of for their hard work and dedication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Branding and Vision 2019 impacts</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2009 The Primate’s World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF) embarked on a participatory branding initiative after months of careful discernment and planning. The goal is to enable each of us to tell the PWRDF story more clearly and compellingly.  As a result, more Anglicans will be activated and inspired to pray, act and give in support of PWRDF ministry. We want to position our organization and our message for maximum impact. We are also looking for new and better ways of connecting with our constituency and beyond.</li>
<li>A great deal of work and planning has taken place, but has been put on hold for the moment
<ul>
<li> as we await decisions about Vision 2019 at the meeting of General Synod 2010,</li>
<li>and review our capacity to take the next steps in light of staff restructuring and budget cuts</li>
<li>Throughout the branding exercise, we have been thankful for the response from Anglicans across Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Acts of Faith Gift Guide</p>
<ul>
<li>This exciting new project brings together the missions and ministries of the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada and its partners (PWRDF, The Anglican Foundation and the <em>Anglican Journal</em>). It was distributed in the April 2010 Anglican Journal and will be distributed again in September.</li>
<li>This gift guide is not intended to supplant or supersede existing fundraising efforts but to augment them by creating an integrated menu of “asks”, with each department showcasing its own work and ask amounts.</li>
<li>PWRDF intends to support this gift guide with additional information on the website that provides Anglicans in Canada with a stronger connection and understanding to the work that they are continually seeking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Other relationships that keep the work of PWRDF strong</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<p>ACT Alliance (Action by Churches Together)</p>
<ul>
<li>ACT International and ACT Development have just formed an international alliance of which PWRDF is a member despite some concerns about the co-branding policy of the new alliance. Recent input from North America has resulted in a modified co-branding policy with some indication of flexibility.  PWRDF continues to support significant relief work through the alliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canadian Council for International Cooperation (CCIC)</p>
<ul>
<li>CCIC continues to provide a forum for knowledge sharing and policy development for regional development programs, in which PWRDF staff participate.  CCIC provided a three-month learning circle opportunity on evaluation in 2008/09, in which Beth Baskin participated.  PWRDF has participated in several recent training opportunities and conversations regarding CIDA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canadian Churches in Action (CCA)</p>
<ul>
<li>Through CCA, PWRDF is participating in two CIDA- funded projects, the post cyclone Nargis response in Burma (Myanmar) and the Sichuan (China) earthquake response, both of which are coming to an end.  PWRDF was on the list of Canadian NGOs which were granted exemption permits from Canadian economic sanctions in Burma.  PWRDF facilitated the transfer of grants to partners for The United Church of Canada and Presbyterian World Service and Development, both of which did not have exemption permits from the Government of Canada.  CCA members meet face-to-face twice a year and via teleconference call on other occasions.  Naba Gurung is the PWRDF representative on CCA. CCA is also facilitating a shared project through ACT Alliance in Haiti following the recent earthquake there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB)</p>
<ul>
<li>PWRDF funded the participation of a Winnipeg priest in a 2009 food study tour to Haiti organized by the Canadian Foodgrains Bank.</li>
<li>PWRDF staff participates regularly in workshops and provide resource feedback and distribution as part of both Public Engagement and Communications work.</li>
<li>PWRDF has produced a separate report available at the General Synod meeting that highlights the significant development programming that has been accomplished through donations of $131,960  augmented by budget allocations for a total PWRDF equity of  $212,000. Through CFGB &amp; CIDA matching programs that sum has grown to $1,008,220 providing food and food education in eight countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR)</p>
<ul>
<li>Though the Canadian Council for Refugees, PWRDF continues to work tirelessly on policy issues for refugees.</li>
<li>PWRDF staff participate in CCR gatherings and information networks and share relevant information with PWRDF volunteers for local response.</li>
</ul>
<p>Canadian Ecumenical Anti-Racism Network (CEARN)</p>
<ul>
<li>CEARN has developed a resource on racism and Indigenous peoples rights released on May 26, 2009, “The National Day of Healing and Reconciliation.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Global Anglican Relief and Development Alliance (GARDA)</p>
<ul>
<li>PWRDF was part of a steering committee brought together by Lambeth Palace and the Anglican Communion Office following Lambeth Conference 2008 to work towards the establishment of this international alliance.  The steering committee created a consultation document on the proposed Global Anglican Relief and Development Alliance.  PWRDF collected input from Anglicans in Canada.  That data together with analysis from PWRDF and Partnerships staff was included in a response to the GARDA document.  The steering committee meets at Lambeth Palace in April 2010 to plan next steps, including a possible launch later this year.<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives</p>
<ul>
<li>KAIROS faced substantial budget cuts in 2008 that resulted in re-mandating process and a new organizational structure. Late in 2009 they received news that they would not be signing a new agreement with CIDA and are currently exploring options. Thank you to all the Anglicans who were very active in articulating their concerns to the government in response to this decision.</li>
<li>Their work has continued including a church leaders’ delegation to the tar sands in May 2009 in which retired bishop Tom Morgan represented the Anglican Church of Canada in the KAIROS.</li>
<li>A national gathering for KAIROS was held in June 2009 called “The End of the World as We Know It: Thank God”.  PWRDF staff and six volunteers attended to be part of a significant networking and education event.</li>
</ul>
<p>World Council of Churches (WCC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It has not been a priority for PWRDF to participate in the annual May and September WCC ecumenical roundtable meetings for several years and budget has not been assigned for 2009/2010.   PWRDF does participate in the World Council of Churches Relations committee for Canada which meets up to twice annually.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<p>Budget 2010</p>
<ul>
<li>The Board at its October 2009 meeting requested a complete review of the budget for 2010/2011 with an eye to significant reduction, and mandated the Budget Review Working Group to give immediate attention to this matter.   An important piece of context is that we had drawn on our Reserve Fund – close to $1 million – to maintain grants to partners in 2009. This was a result of the refocused CIDA funded program in which PWRDF re-directed CIDA funds to a smaller number of partners. In an effort to replenish the Reserve Fund, to balance the budget, to end deficit budgeting and to set us on a path of sustainable budget equilibrium, the Budget Review Working Group proposed a 26% reduction in the budget for 2010/2011 and a further 10% reduction in the budget for each of the next two years.  At its December 2009 meeting the Executive Committee approved this proposal.</li>
<li>As a result of the budget reductions, program delivery costs must be reduced.  These budget cuts were accompanied by a plan for staff restructuring based on organisational needs to resource PWRDF programs.</li>
<li>The new staff structure takes effect on April 1.  The significant change in the staff structure is the creation of a Partnership Program Team that brings together the development and relief program staff with the public engagement and education program staff, formerly residing in two staff teams.</li>
<li>PWRDF’s new staff structure will be led by two managers:  Elsa Tesfay (Development Partnership Program Manager) and Jill Martin (Finance and Administration Manager).  As a result of the new structure, however, PWRDF will lose Beth Baskin who has served as Public Engagement Team Leader for four and a half years with her passion for justice.</li>
<li>The great difficulty in this restructuring is the impact on staff.  In addition to the loss of one team leader position, a further five positions have been eliminated: Communications Associate, Africa Development Program Officer, Latin America-Caribbean, Refugee Program Officer, Donor Relations Officer, Indigenous Communities Development Program Coordinator.</li>
<li>Three new positions have been created to meet the organisational needs of PWRDF programs.  The new positions are: Communications Facilitator; CIDA Development Program Coordinator; and Public Engagement Program Coordinator.</li>
<li>Effective April 1, 2010 the Indigenous Communities (Canada) Development Program will be combined with the Latin America – Caribbean Development Program.  The very basis of the PWRDF Indigenous Communities Development Program is to meet the aspirations of Indigenous communities for self-determination and that remains in this new coordinator position.</li>
<li>Other changes resulting from the restructuring include job description changes and reduction in work hours for several staff.  The Board is confident that these decisions will enable PWRDF to remain strong and able to serve the aspirations of Indigenous communities in Canada and communities in the Global South into the future.</li>
<li>There is a genuine acknowledgement of the financial restraints within which we are working.  Staff are embracing the plan with grace and courage.  They care deeply for one another and they are grateful for the many expressions of care and concern for them and their well being at this time.</li>
<li>At the time of writing this report all except one ( justgenerations. ca<em>Facilitator</em>) of the positions had been filled and the requisite union processes followed to result in the staff complement noted above. As of March 31 Beth Baskin, Public Engagement Team Leader, Jennifer Brown, Donor Relations Officer, and Glen Spurrell, Africa Program Officer will be leaving the employ of PWRDF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. </strong><strong>Follow up from General Synod 2007</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<p>PWRDF supported resolutions at the meeting and subsequently included follow up work in their program plan.</p>
<p>Food and Agriculture (resolution A211)</p>
<ul>
<li>PWRDF became a member of The Canadian Foodgrains Bank in June 2007. This happened at the same meeting as The Canadian Catholic Organization of Development and Peace became a member, which means that 85% of Christian denominations in Canada are now represented by CFGB. CFGB supports members as they work with their partners locally to provide food aid, and work for food justice and security.</li>
<li>PWRDF and Partnerships:
<ul>
<li>promoted CFGB resources through parish mailings</li>
<li>worked together on the 2010 accountability report</li>
<li>plan to find new ways to support local Anglicans in their growing projects and other CFGB related actions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (resolution A213)</p>
<ul>
<li>PWRDF and Partnerships staff worked together:
<ul>
<li> To provide information about the work we do and how it accomplishes the MDGs.</li>
<li>To support a MDG walk in Ottawa in September 2008 led by Archbishop Hiltz and Lutheran Bishop Johnson.</li>
<li>With The Canadian Council of Churches in planning for a Multi-faith leaders gathering in May 2010 in concert with the G8 leaders meeting taking place in Huntsville Muskoka in June 2010.</li>
<li>To circulate information and promote opportunities for Anglicans in Canada to learn more about the MDGs and take action locally</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several Country focussed resolutions were passed and actions taken by the PWRDF  staff responsible for those  regions</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7. </strong><strong>Celebrations</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<ul>
<li>We give thanks that every year as volunteers complete terms of service, locally and nationally there are new people to take their place and carry on as ambassadors for PWRDF across Canada.</li>
<li>We give thanks for the unknown parishioners, parish treasurers, and diocesan treasurers who ensure that over three million dollars in donations make it to our office each year.</li>
<li>We give thanks for a new level of awareness and education that will strengthen PWRDF into the future and ensure that children who place their pennies in a coin box in 2010 will tell the story in 2060.</li>
<li>We give thanks for staff who go beyond their job descriptions because of the passion and commitment to transforming the world.</li>
<li>We give thanks for partners who continue to tell us what works in their communities and invite us to accompany them on the journey to make it happen.</li>
</ul>
