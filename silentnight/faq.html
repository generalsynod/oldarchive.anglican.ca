      <h3>Who will participate?</h3>
      <p>The Silent Night Project encourages every Canadian Anglican to participate, even those outside of Canada. Anywhere you happen to be in the world, sing the hymn &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; on Sunday, November 28, and you will be part of the project. And if you make a videotape of yourself (or your group or parish) singing &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; and send it to us, you can share your testament of grace with everyone else.</p>
      <h3>How do I make a video?</h3>
      <p>Making a video can be a very simple process. Many groups or parishes have at least one or two members with digital video cameras. If you ask for a knowledgeable volunteer, they will be able to set the camera up on a tripod or table, make sure the whole group can be seen in the frame, turn it on and away you go.</p><p>
        Of course, you can get a lot fancier than that. Many people, especially younger people, have wonderful creativity and visual skills. If that&rsquo;s the case in your group or parish, go for it! You can get as inventive as you like, then send us the video in any format so we can share it with the whole world.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>How and when will we see the final video?</h3>
      <p>By Christmas, a compilation video of all the &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; performances will be available on YouTube, the online video sharing site. However, you must submit your video by December 14, 2010 in order for it to be included.</p>
      <h3>Take a photo of your group singing!</h3>
      <p>If you wish, email us a still photo of your group singing. We will use the photos on the website in December.&nbsp;<a href="/silentnight/faqphotos.html">We have information on the best photo formats</a>.</p>
      <h3>Do we need to sing the entire hymn?</h3>
      <p>No, you can sing as many verses as you choose to sing.</p>
      <h3>Where did this idea come from?</h3>
      <p>In 2008, thousands of generous and creative Canadian Anglicans participated in the <a href="/amazinggrace">Amazing Grace Project</a>. More than 500 videos were compiled into an award-winning documentary, <em>Amazing Together</em>, and more than $95,000 was raised for suicide prevention in northern Canada. </p><p>
        This project was such a success that the Primate, Archbishop Fred Hiltz, launched a similar project for 2010—the Silent Night Project: Anglicans promote peace in the spirit of Amazing Grace.</p>
      <h3>Where do I send my cheque?</h3>
      <p>Thank you for your generous contribution to the ministry of Canadian Anglican military chaplains. Please make cheques out to &quot;The Silent Night Project&quot; and send them to</p>
