  <p>Christine Hills, communications associate for the <a href="https://www.pwrdf.org/">Primate’s World Relief and Development Fund</a> (PWRDF), talks about how the “Facing AIDS, Facing Reality” exhibit was an inspiring and educational example of how to “transform unjust structures.” The photography exhibit, co-produced by PWRDF and <a href="https://www2.anglican.ca/about/departments/cir/video/index.htm">Anglican Video</a>, travelled to every diocese in Canada and to 50 different communities, raising awareness and generating funds for people living with HIV and AIDS. </p>
  <p>The money raised by the “Facing AIDS, Facing Reality” exhibit went to <a href="https://www.pwrdf.org/our-work/hivaids-initiative/">Partnership for Life</a>, PWRDF’s HIV and AIDS initiative. This initiative worked passionately towards its mission: “For a Generation Without AIDS.” They supported programs such as a Kenyan training initiative for widows and orphans and a Tanzanian “Youth Against AIDS” program.</p>
  <p>In this video, Ms. Hills talks about the overwhelming response of people who saw the exhibit—they were profoundly touched and educated. She proclaims the project was one of the best she’s been involved with since coming to Church House. </p>
