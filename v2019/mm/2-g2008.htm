  <p>Youth ministry was the focus of <a href="https://www.generation.anglican.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=291&Itemid=2">Generation 2008</a>, a six-day conference held in London, Ont. last June. The conference was an example of equipping people to “teach, baptize, and nurture new believers,” and Judy Steers, coordinator for youth initiatives at General Synod, was lead organizer.</p>
  <p>Generation 2008 was a huge success. It drew 160 youth ministry leaders from 27 dioceses across Canada. The agenda included workshops, speakers, and even community drumming sessions. Ms. Steers explains that it was a valuable opportunity for youth leaders to get together to network, learn, support each other, and develop their skills in nurturing young believers.</p>
