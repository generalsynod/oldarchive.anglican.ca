	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>I agree Lynda - Jesus was about building relationships that would support the growth that happens when we delve into the Word. Personally I have found Jesus to be anything but easy, but I believe fervently in what his mission was and continues to be. I aspire to one day pray unceasingly for all those members that make up Christ&#039;s body(inside or outside the corporate &quot;Church&quot;, aware or unaware)that all will be well amongst them one day! Most days now I just pray for those who are closest to me personally and in trouble, but I do with God&#039;s help pray for those who are my enemies. I believe that is what Christ challenges us to do. God&#039;s blessings on this forum.</description>

		<description>Thank you Lynda D from BC. You are in my mind spot on. You are so right. I pray for the day when we stop polaying the numbers game and get on with the sould game. We need bold leaders preaching a bold message of salavation and living the Gospel inside and outside of the church. In my own life as one of those leaders I pray everyday I am faithful to this message. Blessings.</description>
