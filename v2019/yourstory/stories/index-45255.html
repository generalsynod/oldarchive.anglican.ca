	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Thank you, John.  You present great news.  As a retired priest it has been my privilege to provide ministry in a variety of settings.  For the most part what you outline here has not been heard and the church is suffering for it.  The good news is that when it is heard, there is an excitement and an enthusiasm that is contageous.  I&#039;m impatient and unwilling to wait for the passage of another decade.  With each Sunday liturgy and each weekly home study I lead I see the Journey moving forward.  It&#039;s not big, but it&#039;s authentic.

		<description>Thank you for this reflection.  It sounds like what I&#039;ve been trying to express in different contexts and occasions.   Hal</description>

		<description>Very moving words and a hopeful vision.  You have my admiration and respect for the work you do and the ministry in which you serve.  I, too, agree that much of what we must look toward for the next 10 years (and beyond) is reclaiming the importance of the baptismal covenant as core to our common life.
