		<description>Bishop Kerr-Wilson!

I can think of no one else more suitable to carry the torch of our beloved St. Peter!  It&#039;s been 8 years of me in the wilderness, and I thought I&#039;d drop you a line to say hello!  Since I left the Church, the world has been a difficult place through which to navigate.  As my 37th year approaches, I still find myself here.

I wish you and your beloved family all the best in the years to come.

Remember me in your prayers, 

Former Postulant, 

Richard Karl McGurk</description>

		<description>Elaine Y. has identified the most important issue facing the Anglican Church. 

Will The Anglican Church of Canada in 2019 be the beacon of &quot; The Good News of The Gospel of Christ&quot; as we have known the church to be in our generation? 

I pray it will. 

However, I am concerned the church will not meet that obligation, according to the teachings of the scripture, due to the desire of the leadership of The Anglican Church to accommodate all communities of the population who promote their own agenda in the name of the church. 

&quot;We must not manipulate the interpretation of the scripture to suit our own wants, needs or life style.

We should not allow vocal minority groups to use the church to advance their own agenda or life style.

		<description>Thank you, Suzanne.  I know I speak for many others when I say that your recommendation meets a great and growing need. It also connects us, in a number of ways, to the early Church, where leaders gave direct and ongoing support to the small church communities.  At a time when we feel keenly the threat of fragmentation your ideas suggest new models of unity.</description>

		<description>Sadly,you are probably correct, there is not much hope of ever regaining the members who have left or attracting new ones, who would enter an arena of conflict and turmoil to find Jesus who is the Prince of Peace? We appear as  loose canons in the ecumenical world, the only press we get is legal dirty laundry. The orthodox churches exhibit a siege mentality and the Anglican Journal has become a state of war update. Pray that God will deliver us and restore us to our mission and faithfulness.</description>

		<description>What would it look like,this partnership with other faiths? Worship, say. 

Could we worship with Muslims? They think Jesus is a prophet, but not God&#039;s Son. They think he wasn&#039;t crucified on the cross. 

For Anglicans who are Christians, we see Jesus as Saviour of our souls, having offered to God a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice, one that demonstrates God&#039;s grace to sinners. 

These beliefs are incompatible. Christians and Muslims do not worship the same diety. 

I don&#039;t get what you&#039;re saying - it certainly doesn&#039;t make sense. If you&#039;re thinking of sharing worship with other Christians of a different denomination, then I&#039;m all for it. God&#039;s Kingdom transcends denominational lines when Jesus is at the centre of our interest. That&#039;s why so many Christian radio stations are successful. The speakers preach the Scriptures, not church life. The songs magnify Jesus Christ, and CHristians can wholeheartedly worship him without constraints of denominational focus.</description>

		<description>Love your creativity for a special event like the road race. I remember running a road race on Good Friday, so I used a marker to write this text on the back of my shirt to witness to the other runners, &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; [Romans 5:8]</description>

		<description>Stay strong in the fight sir, steady in the race and keep the faith. One day you will receive a crown from our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. It will be a glorious day when we hear him say to you, &quot;Well done good and faithful servant!&quot;</description>

		<description>I was absolutely delighted to read this inspiring and uplifting vision for 2019.  I thoroughly endorse these sentiments that the future of the Anglican church should be &quot;a vibrant, worshipful, biblically literate, praying, loving and growing community of faith&quot;.  Education gives us credibility; worship and prayer builds community, thus a sense of purpose and belonging in God&#039;s creation.  Credibility and community make us relevant in today&#039;s world, thus encouraging growth...which is just another way of saying &quot;sharing the love of Christ with more and more people&quot;...which is exactly what God calls us to do.
