				<small>Sent to us on September 18th, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p align="center"><strong>St. Augustine‘s Parish Visioning – September 13<sup>th</sup>, 2009</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>St. Augustine’s Anglican Church is a moderate sized parish consisting of approximately 350 families. We are located adjacent to Memorial University (about 20,000 students) and are surrounded on one side by 987 low cost housing units where the average income per household is $14,000.00.  We enjoy a strong outreach to our neighbourhood through outreaches like the Community Kitchen, support of the local Community Center, an outreach of hospitality to the university campus and a warm and inviting worshipping community.  We are very proud of our Gospel Band and the appeal they have generated through their ministry.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>We are blessed to have a fairly modern church building, built in the shape of an ark, it is 6 sided and is very ascetically pleasing. Our church building holds about 500 people and between our three Sunday services, we average approximately 160 – 180 per Sunday.  Our Hall is also built for hospitality and can sit about 200 people for a meal.  About 50 parishioners took part in our visioning workshop</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“As a Parish, we see that St. Augustine’s is in a time of transition.  The society that many of us began our church life in has changed dramatically. The promise of a housing development our church was built in the midst of has been replaced by the University, Hospital and other commercial ventures.   Our Church’s prominence within society and the changes in the school system has caused a major rethinking of how we reach out to our young families.  Many original families to our church have experienced the pain of out migration.  Part of St. Augustine’s parishioner’s pain includes the sense of failure many feel in knowing that their own children have made choices that have led them away from the Church.  While at times we long for simpler days, we are pleased that our Lord has placed these challenges before us and has encouraged us to respond with a transformational faith – and we see evidence of this transformational faith all around us.</p>
<p>As we long for an increased number of young families, we find ourselves rejoicing in the youth who call St. Augustine’s home.  As a church, we know that it is never enough to want young families, it is also in making young families feel welcome that always must be a priority.  We know that as St. Augustine’s continues to transform, it must celebrate all ages, knowing that each generation offers significant insights and contributions to the body of Christ.  One way, that we as a parish wish to do this, is learning from other churches and denominations of their success and seeking to share our successes and resources with sister churches within our city.  In saying this, we are aware of our unique heritage, and that we never want to lose sight of our roots.  St. Augustine’s is at its best when we promote fellowship, address personal issues, work for advocacy, and enhance learning opportunities.</p>
<p>As we engage society, we believe St. Augustine’s  must create additional worship times throughout the week – times for young families whose Sundays are crowded with sports, times for those who work in the area, and times of meditation within our busy lives.  We celebrate our groups who have helped create our church to be a major focus for many of our parishioners, yet we also know that more must be done to enhance our hospitality as we seek to reach out to the community – we continue to seek to make St. Augustine’s a center of worship and fellowship.  We know that making better use of our facilities will promote this vision.</p>
<p><sup> </sup></p>
<p>Christian education is an opportunity to pass on our faith and is a gift from God and must be treated as such.  Whether it be preparation times for Baptism, Marriage Confirmation, or studies of God Word, due honour must be given to these times and the our parish must find ways to not only honour them but uphold them in prayer.  Increased times of prayer, study and learning must be at the center of our outreach.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Draw your church together, O Lord, into one great company of disciples, together following our Lord Jesus Christ into every walk of life, together serving him in his mission to the world, and together witnessing to his love on every continent and island. We ask this in His name and for His sake. Amen.</strong></em></p>

					<p>So, where do I see the Anglican Church in ten years&#8217; time?</p>
<p>Churches and religions behave like snakes. At first seeking to explain the truths and the meaning of the Universe and its Creator to man, their priests are the first scientists. Stonehenge and the Pyramids and the Babylonian Calendar and Laws of Hammurabi bear witness to the remarkable achievements of man at the dawn of history, in constructing languages, in learning numbers,  in understanding the motions of the seasons, predicting eclipses, learning to write, and laying down the basic laws that make it possible for Society to exist.</p>
<p>But just as the snake grows within a skin that fails to grow, and in the end has to burst through it and cast it off, so religions have this same way of fossilizing. A sacred book lays down rules which are accepted as truth for all time, while life and civilization and human understanding progress. In the end, the old ways as they are interpreted become so constricting that that they cannot survive. Some leader &#8211; a Jesus, a Martin Luther or a John Wesley &#8211; perceives the essence of the message that the Church should be preaching, and rephrases it in a wider and more liberal manner. Initially, this snake that has cast its skin is delicate and vulnerable. Later, as the skin hardens and the new truth is reduced to a system, this whole process of fossilization and the clash of modernity with fundamentalism starts once again.</p>
<p>In this time of rapid invention and change, it seems to me that the structures of the Christian church are currently under the same strain. A generation is growing up amid a mass of electronic innovation that simply cannot understand the language the Church is using. So our Church needs to rethink itself, not in terms of insisting on ancient formulas, but by discovering the essence of what its message is, discarding customs and wording that are no longer helpful, and widening its appeal to the needs of the souls of all humankind.</p>
<p>This is beginning to happen. The Authorized Version of the Bible has been replaced by many more accurate and readable translations. Our Alternative Services, though an interim measure, have been found very practical. We are reaching out to an understanding and appreciation of the beliefs of other denominations, perhaps a prelude to greater cooperation, if not actual union, between churches. We have not yet reached the point of respecting and understanding the value of the insights and practices of other, non-Christian religions. We have not yet given recognition to whoever it is who will be called to be the Luther who will lead the next Reformation, who, as ever, is likely to be treated as a blasphemer and disrupter of our established religious order &#8211; as is Prince Charles, when he wishes to be regarded as &#8220;Defender of Faith&#8221; rather than &#8220;Defender of THE faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet we do have to recognize that the real divide in this world is between those who acknowledge, in some way or another, a Creator, a spiritual world, and a duty so to pass through this life as to be worthy to enjoy eternal life in the next. This contrasted with those who &#8220;worship the creature rather than the Creator&#8221;, whose &#8220;portion of life is in this world&#8221;, and whose life has no purpose other than the accumulation of possessions, power and prestige, without regard for the welfare of their fellows.</p>
<p>The next ten years will surely tell us more. And I believe that the Anglican Church, though not a complete answer in itself, will yet be a vital part of the process.</p>

					<p><strong>Where is the Church Today?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Anglican Church of Canada is madly trying to define itself to help us pull out of the theological and financial crisis we are in &#8212; and that’s good as long as we don&#8217;t become too introspective.</li>
<li>The Anglican Church of Canada is just starting to move itself out of being a somewhat  power-driven Institutional Church where rules and individual power can rule and speed of change is often  measured in decades rather than in months.</li>
<li>The Anglican Church of Canada in places is experiencing winds of the spiritual renewal but not across theological, geographical, diocesan or generational lines. God is, I believe, alive in our ACC and sowing seeds of Hope and there are places alive with His Spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is my vision for the ACC in 2019?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My dream is that more of our very able theologians will dedicate themselves to publishing so that we can begin to define who we are and not have to look only to other provinces.</li>
<li>My dream is that we will be celebrating open altars across this country where all who feel drawn to Christ may partake of the Eucharist.</li>
<li>My dream is that lay people will be taking their rightful place within ACC,  will be telling their own stories of their faith journeys and will be working alongside our ordained to build a Church faithful to our Baptismal Covenant.</li>
<li>My dream is that we will have had the courage to re-structure the organization of our ACC without throwing out the essence of who we are as Anglicans.</li>
<li>My dream is that we will recognize, be open to and listen to the voice of our modern-day prophets who may come from unsuspecting places.</li>
<li>My dream is that God will still be alive in the ACC and that more ministry and mission will be done to the glory of God.</li>
</ul>
<p>God bless us everyone in our journeys in the next 10 years!</p>

					<p>I am an Anglican and also a full time staff member of Alpha Canada Ministries. I oversee the Atlantic region and also the development of The Marriage and The Marriage Preparation Courses as well as the new Parenting Courses in Canada. I work with all denominations and ministries so find it interesting to be in churches and traditions other than my own &#8211; it stretches me and gives me a broader perspective.</p>
<p>I get frequent emails from couples looking for a Marriage Preparation Course after they google &#8220;marriage preparation&#8221; and find our website at: <a href="http://www.themarriagecourse.ca/" target="_blank">www.themarriagecourse.ca</a>. Many have no relation to a church, but sense that this course, although based on Christian principles might have the practical information they are looking for. Often, they make a connection with a church by taking the course and beginning a relationship with us (they are relieved to see we are normal!). Unfortunately, there are not many churches running the course which I find so frustrating as it is an opportunity to bridge the gap between the outside and inside the church and we are not able to provide a church with a registered course.</p>
<p>I would LOVE our Anglican Church to embrace some of the new tools to reach those outside the church (our kids who we long to be part of a faith that has sustained us). The Alpha course is one example. I just returned from an International Alpha Conference in London, England where we heard wonderful testimonies from over 100 countries of transformations of churches where young people had come to know what Christianity is all about. There were 75 Bishops in attendance (many attended a lunch meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury!)</p>

					<p>I believe our beloved church is at a stage of assuming a new and emerging identity.  Those who cling to a past identity of the church often seek refuge from anything that exhibits change.  Those who embrace an emerging identity often lose patience with others who do not share the vision.</p>
<p>Despite these apparent conflicting views, one thing should remain true and foundational &#8211; we are people of GOOD NEWS!</p>
<p>I dream of a church that seeks only to tell the GOOD NEWS even if there is still a misunderstanding of what this Good News actually means.</p>
<p>I vision a church that seeks to partner with secular groups to show that Christ&#8217;s mission is indeed incarnational.  That is, we continue to show forth the &#8220;word made flesh&#8221; in our daily activities as a church living in the world.</p>
<p>I hope for a church that does not need to ask &#8220;where will we be in ten years time,&#8221; but asks &#8220;where do we need to be right now!&#8221;</p>
<p>I pray for a church that remains Christ-centred and wonders not &#8220;why have I chosen God,&#8221; but &#8220;why has God chosen me?&#8221;</p>
<p>I seek a changing church that responds to the unchanging grace that God gives to those who seem outside or forgotten by both the church and the world.</p>
<p>I know that we are a church that will have a place in the world, even if those within think we have lost our way.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity,</p>
<p>Fr. Sam Rose<br />
Diocese of Eastern Newfoundland &amp; Labrador</p>

					<p>I dream that parishes may one day be the setting for theological education for all the baptized. I look forward to seeing parishes as lively centres of learning and debate, with clergy and lay people working together as partners in learning. I would like to see a church in which all people in a parish have the opportunity to develop a basic understanding of the Christian faith, of the variety and richness of its Anglican expression, and of the way that our faith is expressed in the cultural setting in which they live. I dream of a church where people come together to share their stories and to bring the events of their daily lives into dialogue with the story of the Christian faith. The church should be a place where each person&#8217;s story can be heard and valued by others.</p>
<p>I believe that people in the church are hungry for learning about the Christian faith, and I hope that the next decade will be one of renewed emphasis on teaching and learning. Seminaries should be places where clergy can develop skills in education and training to enable this to happen &#8211; to enable lay people to begin to think theologically about their everyday life and work. I dream of a church where each member shares in worship and learning, in outreach and service, each offering gifts to build up the Body of Christ and to spread the good news of God&#8217;s love for all.</p>
