	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Sadly,you are probably correct, there is not much hope of ever regaining the members who have left or attracting new ones, who would enter an arena of conflict and turmoil to find Jesus who is the Prince of Peace? We appear as  loose canons in the ecumenical world, the only press we get is legal dirty laundry. The orthodox churches exhibit a siege mentality and the Anglican Journal has become a state of war update. Pray that God will deliver us and restore us to our mission and faithfulness.</description>
