	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Jesus said his Kingdom was not of this world. [48sec.] Compare that with what Jesus said. &lt;a HREF=&quot;https://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?q=John+18%3A36&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;John 18:36&lt;/A&gt; Shouldn&#039;t our church get on track with what Jesus thinks is going on? Of course we want to reveal the character of Jesus to others, and to be instruments of God&#039;s love to others - those are good things... 

The final comment by Denise references PWRDF, not the church at large, but I suppose that&#039;s not unreasonable.</description>
