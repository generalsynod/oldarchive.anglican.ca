					<p><strong>Vision 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>In 2019 </strong>we find a church that is not anxious about protecting its ‘religious turf’ but united with Anglicans and other Christians seeking to know &amp; practice the love of God in the world.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The discussion at St. Marks centered around the Five Marks of Mission</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>To proclaim the good news of the Kingdom</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Now: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>based on a traditional model of church building, priest &amp; paid staff, lay ministering congregation with various levels of engagement/commitment</li>
</ul>
<p>Proclamation happens through many programs related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>traditional BCP &amp; contemporary worship utilizing multimedia technology</li>
<li>pastoral care by the lay ministers, deacon, and the priest</li>
<li>Christian education utilizing current curriculums available</li>
<li>community building / fellowship  events</li>
<li>outreach in the wider community.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2019</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lay      ministers regularly reflect upon and update church programs as needed.      Church members have found language and processes to that easily expresses      differences in opinion and find resolutions without alienating others.</li>
<li>The arts are prominent in our church programs. The use of story telling, live music, drama, crafters, textiles &amp; symbols in worship and community life are all flourishing.</li>
<li>2019      finds us excited and hopeful in the spaces where we worship. We have      worked with other deanery parishes to make tough decisions as to how to      maintain and  protect the      heritage of our church buildings. The process has renewed us.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To teach, baptize &amp; nurture new believers:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Programs      use current curriculums for Sunday school, baptism, first communion,      confirmation, marriage prep.</li>
<li>We      are adjusting to our cultural context which is viewed as a barrier to      church involvement:</li>
<li>We      are one of many religions &amp; Christians no longer attract parishioners      by  ‘divine  right’</li>
<li>Busy      families are trying to maintain two careers; children attend daycare all      week</li>
<li>Family      time falls on Sunday morning; worship is not a priority</li>
<li>Higher      value placed on embracing all religions and creeds</li>
<li>Rampant      consumerism,  Sports      activities,  computer games,</li>
<li>Church      alienation: Past abuses, residential schools, past white male model</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2019</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Faith      language that illuminates Christian fundamental beliefs (without being      fundamentalist) is understood and commonly used.</li>
<li>Other      religions &amp; faith experiences are valued</li>
<li>Christian      identity &amp; unity has ‘good self esteem’ in relation to other secular,      spiritual and religious belief systems. The well adjusted Christian enhances      the human spiritual journey and understanding/ love of God.</li>
<li>New      parents with small children are encouraged through new culturally relevant      programs and ways of connecting with them, using the web and other current      technology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>To respond to human need through loving service:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Priest,      deacon and some lay ministers visit those in need.</li>
<li>Caring      is based on relationships formed through working together on various      projects in the past and on a volunteer work ethic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2019</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The      diaconate is common and flourishing, providing relationship &amp;      community building activities &amp; education needed to engage lay ministry.</li>
<li>We      focus on the strengths &amp; needs of the local neighbourhood while      thinking globally</li>
<li>We      are prepared to minister to our large older population of seniors in the      church with volunteers to provide transportation &amp; other practical      services if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To seek to transform unjust structures of society.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our local church provides important ‘band aids’ to a serious societal problems</li>
<li>i.e. Food bank, Daily bread meals, Christmas shoe boxes, Hunger Fund, Food Vouchers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2019:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Identify      what are unjust structures and where the responsibility lies to help</li>
<li>Lobby      appropriate groups as a congregation &amp; national church</li>
<li>Recognize      that unless our youth are helped to understand issues there will be no      changes in future generations</li>
<li>Try      to incorporate values through the peer relationships</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation and sustain and renew the life of the earth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recycling: Paper, cans, plastic, composting coffee grounds, merchandise for bazaars</li>
<li>Reducing: Low flow toilets, cutting electricity consumption with low wattage bulbs , high efficiency heating and cooling, low wattage appliances</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2019</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go Green; stay engaged with the process</li>
<li>Be advocates for cleaner energy solar &amp; wind &amp; less use of plastics &amp; foam</li>
<li>Drought resistant gardens,</li>
<li>Support local  products; aim for 100 mile radius for food products</li>
</ul>

					<p><strong>My 2019 vision for our Church</strong></p>
<p>From: Doug, London Ontario</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>: </strong></p>
<p>First let me thank you for this wonderful opportunity to share my hope for our Church in this Vision 2019 survey.  This is a wonderful idea.  Your use of technology in reaching out and soliciting feedback is something that’s very welcome.  Primate Hiltz’s presentation using <strong>You Tube</strong> was excellent and I would encourage many more such endeavours for ongoing communications to the faithful.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My story</span></strong>:</p>
<p>I am the spouse of a clergy person, who inspires me everyday with her resolute commitment and faithful devotion to God’s purposes in her life, and in God’s church.  It is the ministry of gifted people like this, plus the empowerment of all God’s faithful who are called to make a difference in our world today.</p>
<p>In some small way this is my very little contribution of hope for God’s Church.  Thank you again for the opportunity to share it with you.</p>
<p>Yours in Christ</p>
<p>Doug</p>
<p><strong>Our God</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alpha and Omega</span></strong>: Where all Anglicans believe in hope, seek greater understanding, and are continually transformed by faith in our Lord Jesus, stirred by the Spirit, and all for the Glory of God the Father.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our leadership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parish pastoral leadership</span></strong>: Where priests and deacons are people of deep faith, who lead their flock with inspiration.  Where leadership is challenged to pursue a life of holiness, and in turn challenge their flock in the same way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivate and challenge</span></strong>:  Where priests and deacons are able to facilitate the mobilization and care of their flock, through word and example.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Episcopal leadership</span></strong>: Where our church leadership seeks to nurture and inspire our priests and deacons.  Labouring in the fields, our pastors require care, support, encouragement and love, and recognition from those in Episcopal leadership.  .</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where talented prospective candidates are encouraged to consider and pursue their calling</span></strong>:  Where people of faith, with leadership skills and gifts for effective communication and devotion are identified.  People need to be encouraged to consider the possibility of a life in ministry, starting with the ministry of the laity.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where the church leadership honestly guides prospective candidates in their calling</span></strong>:  Where people with leadership aspirations, but who are better suited to the vitally important ranks of the laity, are challenged to realistically assess God’s calling in their life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our parish homes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A gathering of the faithful believers, living out their baptismal covenant</span></strong>: A place where believers are actively living out their Baptismal Covenant, seeking to answer our Lord’s question, “<em>Who do you say that I am?</em>”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A community prepared to repent and earnestly turn to God</span></strong>:  A community with people of faith who are always ready to admit their failings, and turning to God for the grace to mend their ways.  A place of prayer, where people kneel and ask God for his presence.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Care motivated by love</span></strong>:  A place of worship that creates an environment which enables its parishioners to care for and love fellow parishioners.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A welcoming community</span></strong>: A community that creates an inviting and welcoming atmosphere for the surrounding community, and those who visit.  Where members seek to share about their life stories with their sisters and brothers.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People who <em>both</em> speak but as importantly … <em>listen</em></span></strong>:  Where we stop arguing.  Where parishioners speak the truth in love, but do this while equally listening in love.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where people don’t have to have their own way … “or else”</span></strong>:  Where we see the bigger picture that united we grow, that divided we fall.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cares for the sick and shut-ins</span></strong>:  Where the sick and shut-ins are not forgotten, but are regularly visited and prayed for.  We should know that over the years to come more and more parishioners will disappear from our midst.  However, this doesn’t mean they’ll be gone.  Instead, they are still with us but may become shut-ins, needing support and recognition.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both large and small</span></strong>:  Where smaller congregations can join forces, able to pool their resources to support necessary programs, while at the same time creating an environment for encounters of smaller groups for more local fellowship.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With the times</span></strong>:  Where members and leadership would be in step with and appreciate our current society, just as our Lord completely understood the world in which he lived.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A sense of Holy reverence</span></strong>:  Where an environment supports a sense of “<em>Be still and know that I am the Lord your God.</em>”  God’s presence needs to be appreciated.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For young and old</span></strong>:  For a Church that is a place that excites the young, and comforts the elderly, and supports and inspires all.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Church for our times</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A safe community</span></strong>:  A place where the young and vulnerable can come for care, all without fear of abuse or being taken advantage of.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A place for all expressions of worship</span></strong>:  Where the young can rock, and the contemplative can pray in silence.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past and present</span></strong>:  Where the past is respected, appreciated, and understood.  But where the future is embraced and seen as hopeful.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free from the battles of race and gender</span></strong>:  Where we live and worship in a space where “<em>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, <strong>male nor female</strong>, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</em>”  Where women and men equally share in God’s blessing, and together work in true partnership.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Free from the battles of pelvis politics</span></strong>:  Where we accept <strong><em>all</em></strong> our brothers and sisters.  Where we, blessed with companionship, live a life of faithful commitment, devoted to our partners in love, just as Christ loves his Church.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Finally, on the practical side</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Name tags</span></strong>:  Where names tags are used regularly, for those of us who continually forget our brothers and sisters name.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A place for all to hear</span></strong>:  Where our parish sound systems, properly configured to deliver clear sound quality for all to hear.</li>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bring back the Church sponsored bible studies</span></strong>:  For those of us who remember the 80’s, there was the church sponsored bible study programs in the Diocese of Toronto.  I was a member of a team leading such studies in our parish of Grace Church on the Hill.  Unfortunately, true to my state of mind, I forget the official name of the program.  However, I can’t forget the wonderful times of fellowship, learning, and sharing in life’s experiences and God’s call.</li>

					<p>I would like to see my local Anglican congregation still thriving amongst a larger Parish here on the Bruce Peninsula. We already work with others to be able to remain with a small group. To be a faith community which includes our ELCIC (Lutheran) brothers &amp; sisters &amp; welcomes all to our Table. For this to happen we need to keep receiving new members into our midst &amp; to go out into our community serving as a witness to our love. I would like to see people walking together in their diversity, celebrating our joy in the Spirit without judging others who choose to worship in a different way. I wish you well as you seek to build our church into the future. Thank you, God Bless, Love Jean</p>

					<p><strong>VIEW FROM WINDSOR &amp; ESSEX COUNTY:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Dynamic Growth from Evangelical Churches<strong>: Windsor Christian Fellowship (10 full time pastors); Lakeshore St. Andrew&#8217;s (2500 adherents, started as St. Andrew&#8217;s Presbyterian by the Lake with very small budget and parish, all of which changed under Chuck Congram); Parkwood Gospel Temple (large congregation, and initiator of &#8220;Celebrate Recovery&#8221;); plus numerous other smaller churches. </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY: dynamic messages reflecting the needs of the 21st. century!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) </strong>Islam<strong>: dynamic growth: appeals to the abandoned, the poor, and disenfranchised. Have replaced the Roman church with 6.2 children per family;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.2 million worldwide, and growing. Did the Archbishop of Canterbury endorse the principle of Shariah Law? If so, is this not extremely dangerous? Is there is a world wide Jihad against us, &#8220;the Infidels&#8221;. Read book by Brigitte Gabrielle, it is both shocking, and relevant if there is even partial truth!!!</strong></p>
<p>Possible Solutions<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- remove &#8220;polical correctness&#8221; from our collective vocabularies. It used to be called diplomacy. Since when is it good business to bend over backwards</strong></p>
<p><strong> for minority left-Liberal thought at the expense of the majority who want to know God more with respect to current times.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- have the Bishops,  local Ministers, and Deacons visit the other churches that are growing to see if there is a message there that will encourage us</strong></p>
<p><strong> to amend our liturgy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- cut back on our &#8220;missions&#8221; temporarily and transfer the funds removed to help our local crises.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- review why we are not attracting more Men to the ministry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- strongly encourage more input from our parishioners on their concerns, not philosophical ideas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- we can use many of the ideas of the &#8220;religious right&#8221; without losing sight of our major strength as Christians.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- we have an epidemic of alcohol drug use, and must get more involved as Christians.</strong></p>
<p>Opinion:<strong> We will continue to experience negative growth to 2019 as Anglicans, unless some dynamic changes are made.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trust the foregoing is helpful,</strong></p>

					<p><strong>For every thing there is a season . . .</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For every thing there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven:<br />
a time to be born and a time to die;<br />
a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted;<br />
a time to kill and a time to heal;<br />
a time to break down and a time to build up . . .</p>
<p>I kept these words from Ecclesiates close to my heart in the late 1990s and early part of the new millennium as the Anglican church I attended closed and then was reborn as something new. The experiences of those years form my vision of what the Anglican Church can be.</p>
<p>Back then, I attended a small, struggling church. The members were for the most part loving, faithful people. Yet there was a feeling we could and should do more in response to God’s call. We learned several nearby Anglican churches – also small and struggling – were having similar thoughts. Four of these churches started to meet and dream about what we could do together that we didn’t have the energy or vision to do separately. A theologian later gave us a word for this convergence – kairos, God breaking into our lives.</p>
<p>We talked, prayed, planned, and researched. We fought, shed tears, gossiped, and spread rumours. Ultimately, we affirmed our passionate love of God, our vision to be faithful disciples of Christ and our desire to incorporate community in all we did. We would no longer live in survival mode; we would step forward with the hope that is ours by faith.</p>
<p>We voted to close our churches and form a new one we would call East London Anglican Ministries – an odd name for a church but chosen to remind us that ministries and mission were what we would be about. We sold our buildings and tossed out many of the accumulated possessions. We spent a year worshipping in a funeral home next to a cemetery (now there’s a Resurrection symbol for you). We bought a commercial building on a major street and renovated and expanded it to fit our vision. The Service of Dedication was held in September 2002.</p>
<p>We have between 150 and 200 on Sundays. After losing members during the amalgamation turmoil, we grew quite rapidly once we opened our doors. It’s teaching us how to think about newcomers in what we do. Worship services are lively. We have about 30 programs, including pastoral support, outreach, study groups, and fundraisers. The nursery is overflowing with little ones. It is not perfect. Once in a moment of black humour, a friend and I joked that we could develop a video game based on the power struggles.</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to get my head around a vision for the entire Anglican Church of Canada in all its diversity from coast to coast to coast. Most of my involvement with the church has been at the local level, so from that experience – particularly what I’ve described above since that had an enormous influence on my faith development – this is what I’ve learned about vision and renewal and what may be possible across the church:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lay people, step up. Take ownership of your church. Stop waiting for the rector or bishop or a benefactor to rescue you. They have key roles in offering expertise and resources, but it’s a collaborative effort to run an effective church. If we truly believe in the priesthood of all believers, we also have to believe God has gifted us with tremendous talent to be released.</li>
<li>Deciding to rebuild a church – and here I don’t mean the building – forces you to go to the roots of faith and ask “Why are we here?” This roots question isn’t one of fundamentalism or traditionalism. It’s a question of Spirit, faith and sacredness. Having the opportunity to explore this question is the most amazing experience.</li>
<li>Likewise deciding to rebuild a church – and here I do mean the building – forces you to let go of church possessions. On the days we went through our old churches’ stuff, we actually had a lot of fun. We kept things of the past that we valued most and lightened our load of the rest – both physically and psychologically.</li>
<li>Take time. Renewal is complex work. Our churches spent six years on planning from the time we said “maybe we can do this” until we moved into our new home. In fact, I don’t think we’re done. In further fact, I don’t think we’ll ever be done. God is constantly revealed to us, bringing about a refocusing of vision.</li>
<li>Have courage. Once you open yourself up to deep changes, there is a period of chaos until the new ways take shape. I have yet to find a way to avoid this stage. The consolation is it does end eventually. The truth is, however, if you’re not willing to change, you may die. So don’t let fear of change hold you back.</li>
<li>The Spirit of God is an energizing, joyful force. Once you respond to God’s call, amazing things will happen to keep you moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading this.</p>

					<p>Currently we as parishioners are involved in worship, education, pastoral care. outreach, abundant living and support for each other as well as financial support of the Church and this is really for only those that have already been moved by the Spirit.</p>
<p>For the future not only do we have to continue with our current programs but we have to bring more energy and excitement to the Church so that  those in our neighbourhoods can feel it, and, reach out to young parents everywhere in some way so that they are moved by the Spirit and show that the Church is willing to help not only locally  but with missionary work as well</p>

<p>Due to the project being in June we only have a handful of our regular children in the photo but have great ideas.</p>
<p>I’ve attached a couple pictures and wanted to let you select which you think might be best.  The children were mostly 7 years old and younger.</p>
