	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>As I said in my original offering, &quot;I dream of a church that seeks only to tell the GOOD NEWS even if there is still a misunderstanding of what this Good News actually means.&quot;

Perhaps, these two responses are an indication that God  can help us to learn to live together as a family that not always agrees but continuously loves.</description>

		<description>Thanks Sam.
What&#039;s the Good News???? 
God so delighted in the world that he sent Jesus so that aLL that believed in Jesus might have eternal life.  God also asks that we love God with all our Heart, Mind Soul and Strength and to love our neighbour as we love ourselves.  Love God and extend that love to the stranger amongst us.  It&#039;s that simple.</description>

		<description>If there are conflicing views of what the GOOD NEWS is, then the leadership of the church needs to get their act together, so that everyone can be telling the same message. It&#039;s not good enough to simply say we have to tell the GOOD NEWS, and then not define it. 

God saves sinners.

That is the GOOD NEWS.</description>
