	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>I was absolutely delighted to read this inspiring and uplifting vision for 2019.  I thoroughly endorse these sentiments that the future of the Anglican church should be &quot;a vibrant, worshipful, biblically literate, praying, loving and growing community of faith&quot;.  Education gives us credibility; worship and prayer builds community, thus a sense of purpose and belonging in God&#039;s creation.  Credibility and community make us relevant in today&#039;s world, thus encouraging growth...which is just another way of saying &quot;sharing the love of Christ with more and more people&quot;...which is exactly what God calls us to do.
