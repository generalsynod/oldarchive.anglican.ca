	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Thank you Brian for responding to my poem.  I do apologize for the typos.  I do not apologize for my theology on evangelism.  I grow weary of Christianity that is exclusive and divisive.  I grow weary of Christianity that sells Jesus like a product rather than believing the scripture that resounds, &quot;If I be lifted up I will draw all unto me...&quot;  Our greatest tool for evangelism is the Eucharist, wherein we share Christ at table. It is by grace and joy, compassion and love, tolerance and inclusiveness.  I have seen people come to God&#039;s light, like moths to the flame, as compassion, love, and tolerance have been given.  In a theology that defines &quot;in and out&quot; who serves as the gate-keeper, who interprets, and by what hermeuitic, the Bible, which moves from guide pointing to The Word, to the words?
I know that we won&#039;t agree, but can we come together around God&#039;s table and receive grace together?  Can we reason to hold together the &quot;communion&quot; even if we don&#039;t see eye to eye? Is it o.k. to think differently about that which we see through a glass darkly?
These are the questions rather than who is in and wo is out, in my humble opinion.</description>

		<description>nice poem, sorry theology around evangelism - the very nature of it is assumes that some people are in and others are not. The point of evangelism is to call those who are not believers to put their trust in Jesus Christ for their salvation. Some people are believers, others are not. Some people are Christians, others are not. Some people trust Jesus as Lord and Saviour, others do not. Evangelism attempts to convert the lost. Evangelism offers information and prayers and persuasions to bring people from the Kingdom of Darkness to the Kingdom of Light.</description>
