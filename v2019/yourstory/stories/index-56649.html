	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Brian&#039;s comments and that of Fr. Michael with respect to homosexual behaviour is totally in line with God&#039;s word.  There is absolutely no way any clergy person - bishops or otherwise - can bless such activity.  It does not matter what words are used or how &quot;dignified&quot; the ceremony might appear.  You cannot force God to bless what is contrary to His word.  Any so-called bishop or clergy person who claims otherwise can only believe he/she is superior to God and that His word is subject to his/her approval.  Would that the House of Bishops and the Primate deal properly with this matter.</description>

		<description>Fr. Michael has got a correct view  of God&#039;s teaching on sexual matters. Homosexual behaviour is wrong, and the church is incorrect when she allows [blesses, accommodates, sanctifies or celebrates] any sexual behaviour outside marriage between a man and a woman. This is a dream that should become a reality.</description>
