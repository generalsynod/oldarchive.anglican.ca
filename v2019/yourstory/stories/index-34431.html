					<p><strong>For every thing there is a season . . .</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For every thing there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven:<br />
a time to be born and a time to die;<br />
a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted;<br />
a time to kill and a time to heal;<br />
a time to break down and a time to build up . . .</p>
<p>I kept these words from Ecclesiates close to my heart in the late 1990s and early part of the new millennium as the Anglican church I attended closed and then was reborn as something new. The experiences of those years form my vision of what the Anglican Church can be.</p>
<p>Back then, I attended a small, struggling church. The members were for the most part loving, faithful people. Yet there was a feeling we could and should do more in response to God’s call. We learned several nearby Anglican churches – also small and struggling – were having similar thoughts. Four of these churches started to meet and dream about what we could do together that we didn’t have the energy or vision to do separately. A theologian later gave us a word for this convergence – kairos, God breaking into our lives.</p>
<p>We talked, prayed, planned, and researched. We fought, shed tears, gossiped, and spread rumours. Ultimately, we affirmed our passionate love of God, our vision to be faithful disciples of Christ and our desire to incorporate community in all we did. We would no longer live in survival mode; we would step forward with the hope that is ours by faith.</p>
<p>We voted to close our churches and form a new one we would call East London Anglican Ministries – an odd name for a church but chosen to remind us that ministries and mission were what we would be about. We sold our buildings and tossed out many of the accumulated possessions. We spent a year worshipping in a funeral home next to a cemetery (now there’s a Resurrection symbol for you). We bought a commercial building on a major street and renovated and expanded it to fit our vision. The Service of Dedication was held in September 2002.</p>
<p>We have between 150 and 200 on Sundays. After losing members during the amalgamation turmoil, we grew quite rapidly once we opened our doors. It’s teaching us how to think about newcomers in what we do. Worship services are lively. We have about 30 programs, including pastoral support, outreach, study groups, and fundraisers. The nursery is overflowing with little ones. It is not perfect. Once in a moment of black humour, a friend and I joked that we could develop a video game based on the power struggles.</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to get my head around a vision for the entire Anglican Church of Canada in all its diversity from coast to coast to coast. Most of my involvement with the church has been at the local level, so from that experience – particularly what I’ve described above since that had an enormous influence on my faith development – this is what I’ve learned about vision and renewal and what may be possible across the church:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lay people, step up. Take ownership of your church. Stop waiting for the rector or bishop or a benefactor to rescue you. They have key roles in offering expertise and resources, but it’s a collaborative effort to run an effective church. If we truly believe in the priesthood of all believers, we also have to believe God has gifted us with tremendous talent to be released.</li>
<li>Deciding to rebuild a church – and here I don’t mean the building – forces you to go to the roots of faith and ask “Why are we here?” This roots question isn’t one of fundamentalism or traditionalism. It’s a question of Spirit, faith and sacredness. Having the opportunity to explore this question is the most amazing experience.</li>
<li>Likewise deciding to rebuild a church – and here I do mean the building – forces you to let go of church possessions. On the days we went through our old churches’ stuff, we actually had a lot of fun. We kept things of the past that we valued most and lightened our load of the rest – both physically and psychologically.</li>
<li>Take time. Renewal is complex work. Our churches spent six years on planning from the time we said “maybe we can do this” until we moved into our new home. In fact, I don’t think we’re done. In further fact, I don’t think we’ll ever be done. God is constantly revealed to us, bringing about a refocusing of vision.</li>
<li>Have courage. Once you open yourself up to deep changes, there is a period of chaos until the new ways take shape. I have yet to find a way to avoid this stage. The consolation is it does end eventually. The truth is, however, if you’re not willing to change, you may die. So don’t let fear of change hold you back.</li>
<li>The Spirit of God is an energizing, joyful force. Once you respond to God’s call, amazing things will happen to keep you moving forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading this.</p>

					<p>MY PARISH CHURCH IN 2019</p>
<p>I hope my parish church in 2019 looks like this:</p>
<p>1.  A congregation focused clearly on active mission locally, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>2.  A church where all are really welcomed not only on the first day they show up but continue to be encouraged to participate in the life of the parish rather than welcomed the first day and then left to find their own way into ministry.</p>
<p>3.  A church where people don‚t Œown‚ a ministry and refuse to give it up or step aside to allow someone else the opportunity to enjoy it also.</p>
<p>4.  A church where we can agree to disagree on some issues and not let that interfere with our friendship and love for those with whom we disagree.</p>
<p>5.  A church where we don‚t always have to do everything the same way but can experiment with liturgy, music and other activities.</p>
<p>6.  A church that recognizes the vast cultural differences which exist throughout the Anglican Communion and can accept them willingly.</p>
<p>7.  A church that recognizes that justice in developing countries requires not just our dollars and other forms of charitable giving but also our representations to our own government on their behalf.</p>
<p>8.  A church in which all members consider seriously their financial commitment and give in a regular and efficient way such as by credit card or automatic bank withdrawal.</p>

					<p>My vision for Anglicans is to be celebrating Jesus&#8217; and God&#8217;s vision for our world, and not so much debating about gays and lesbians.  We are all the children of God.</p>

				<h2>Message from <a href="index-39117.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Ann Marie N., Biggar SK">Ann Marie N., Biggar SK</a></h2>
				<small>Sent to us on September 20th, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>God became incarnate and dwelt and worked among us as one of us.  The Church, which is the body of Christ, needs to follow that example of Christ, not setting itself apart and pulling more into itself but working out and among our communities and the world.  The Incarnation was not just about the future – eternal life – but also about the reign of God in the present.  As followers of Christ we are called to work now to bring God’s kin-dom on earth.  This is not just for those who call themselves Christian but for the whole of creation, including people who do not share our beliefs and for the non-human world.</p>
<p>I would like to see us not have our worship and studies as goals but rather as gifts that help strengthen and equip us for the work to which God calls us.   This would mean that worship needs to be relative to the context of the community.  This does not mean abandoning our worship traditions but building on the underlying meanings and reasons those traditions were developed.</p>
<p>As well, why not find ways of offering the diverse skills to be found in our worshipping communities to help the larger community?  We worry so much about our aging congregations, seeing that as a drawback rather than a gift.  What about retired teachers offering tutoring services in our buildings after school or in the evenings?  What about other gifts that can be offered and shared among the communities we serve?  It is not that the church does not do these things now.  It is that we tend to see them more as special projects rather than as a way of being.</p>
<p>I would like to see us outside our buildings more.  I would like to see more interaction with our communities around use of the buildings.  Instead of having our meetings and studies in our buildings, why not gather in local gathering places where people can see us and get to know us?  Why not offer our buildings as a resource to our communities not as a way of bringing in income but as a way of offering service?</p>
<p>I think the church needs to come to the realization that we need to meet the people where they are rather than expecting them to come to us.  This would mean getting out into the places in the community where the people gather.  As it says in our diocesan profile that place may be the amenity room in a condominium or coffee row in a rural community.  We need to be truly welcoming of all, embracing the diversity around us as gift rather than seeking conformity.</p>
<p>I believe that we need to stop worrying about our own survival and live in faith that God will provide.  Instead of focusing on bringing in more people to serve the maintenance of our buildings and formal structures, we could focus on spreading the good news of the Gospel to those around us by word and by action.  This would mean engaging one on one with individuals or with groups, not just educating ourselves about issues or raising money.  It could involve not only doing our own outreach and mission but also supporting other people’s or groups outreach and mission with our active presence.</p>
<p>It is when the Church has truly been the body of Christ, incarnate among the people, that it has accomplished the most toward the bringing in of the kin-dom.  If we set ourselves apart, if we stay within our buildings, if we insist on people coming to us and conforming, how can we effectively work to address and reach out to the great need for life in our larger communities in the reality of today’s society?</p>
<p>Love and prayers,</p>
<p>Ann Marie N<br />
Biggar, SK</p>

<li>I would like to see our Church &#8212; nationally and throughout every Diocese &#8212; have a carbon reduction plan, and to take very seriously the lifestyle issues required surrounding the challenges of Climate Change.  I would also like to see in our liturgies, and in sermons and prayers of the people, the profound caring for Creation that we, as a people of God, are called to express.</li>
<li>I would like to see some resolution of the same-sex   blessings issue, preferably that our Canadian church would accept a local option for Dioceses; and that our national church would remain in fellowship with the church of the global south and other areas who disagree with our church on this area of human rights and justice.</li>
<li>I would like to see the work and ministry of the First Nations Bishops and communities shared within all Dioceses and all churches so that we can learn from them and their journey of faith as they integrate their cultures with Christian faith and heal from the abuses of the past. This would allow for deeper reconciliation and hopefully the building of new relationships within the Canadian Church.</li>
<li>I would like to see a greater emphasis on youth ministry, and a way (using Facebook perhaps?) to dialogue with young people around issues and questions of faith and life.</li>
</ol>
<p>May God&#8217;s blessing be upon our Church in this visioning process and outcome.</p>

					<p>At this exact moment, the Church of God is at a cusp. It can either accept its prophetic role, as it has done many times over the last two thousand years, or, it can reject that role and slide backwards into oblivion. This church, this great church of ours has accepted in the past its prophetic role to be the bridge between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism; to proclaim and accept that negroes could be fully part of the church; to realize and act on the revelation that the ordained priesthood is rightfully open to female as well as male. Yes, these, and so many more examples of accepting God’s call as a church have regularly occurred over the ages, and once again, today, right now, we are being called to accept a prophetic role to the world to accept all persons of faith as full members of the Anglican Church, the Church of God.</p>
<p>In 2019, I would hope that the church has accepted its call to be a church wherein all Christian men and women are full members, no matter their race, ethnicity, sex or sexual orientation. I pray that it is a church wherein all believers, no matter the sexual orientation, sex, race or ethnicity can proclaim together that Jesus Christ is Lord, that Jesus Christ is King, that Jesus Christ is the most important person in their lives.  I pray that by 2019 that the church, the People of God, is actively on the front line fighting for justice, and proclaiming the Way to the world. I pray that our Anglican church is a leader church which knows the way, shows the way, and goes the way, proclaiming Christ Jesus, making our heavenly Father’s name known, empowered by and living in the Holy Spirit.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>How I see the Anglican Church now and my hope for the Anglican Church in 2019..</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I have been an Anglican all my life. The Anglican Church has been the vehicle by which <em>I have been privileged to express my Christian faith</em>. I love the richness and dignity of all it has to offer, the worship, which involves ones whole being, high regard for scripture, as the recorded word of God, the sacraments, the emphasis on tradition and reason. It allows me to express my faith in God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit in fullness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>But I am saddened that there are things happening that have greatly disappointed and grieved me in its leadership over the past years.</p>
<p>The church is in a terrible crisis – people are hurt, people have left the church. Relationships have been strained or broken. People felt so strongly that they were not being listened to – totally ignored and that there was no alternative but to form their own branch.</p>
<p>Many in the pews are wondering what is happening and don’t know the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent questions asked in any group within the church is “Why are young families and young people not coming into the church”?</p>
<p>Congregations are getting smaller and funds are getting scarce.</p>
<p>When over the last number of years we have made all sorts of changes to make the services and everything relevant to their needs –new liturgies, new prayer book and hymn book, new hymns etc – but they haven’t come!</p>
<p>If the church isn’t offering anything different than the society in which we live is there any good reason for people to attend? They want the church to stand for something and not be just another organization for entertainment.</p>
<p>The Bible is being interpreted to make it say what we want it to say as if those great Anglican Christians of the past had got it all wrong and we in our enlightened age have been given some great new revelation of God.</p>
<p>In 2019 I would hope to see the Anglican Church turn again to the truth and richness of the faith of Jesus Christ and teach all who come through its doors that faith thus enabling it to rise above the culture of the day as St. Paul did in the many places that he ministered.</p>
<p>Yes we can be very good at caring for those in need which is very important but the faith is far deeper than that. We must teach why we are who we are!</p>
<p>Jesus said “If you love me you will keep my commandments”. To love is to live and to edify God’s ways through an informed faith in the power of the Holy Spirit. Human nature has not changed no matter how sophisticated we may think we have become we all need the saving grace of our Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>The church is to make a difference in the world, not the world making a difference in the church.</p>
<p>I believe God is alive in the Anglican Church throughout the world and will continue to be in 2019  but we must get our priorities straight.</p>
<p>Lord hear our prayer!</p>

					<p>Before you ask, &#8220;Where is our church now?&#8221; It should be prefaced with a question as it was asked over 65 years ago when the church faced similar challenges:  &#8221;Who is Jesus Christ for us today?&#8221;  Deitrich Bonhoeff (1941?)  The question remains applicable, now, as was then.</p>

					<p>Reference: Vision 2019</p>
<p>Followers of Jesus are called to love one another (Jn. 34:34), and the Body of Christ is called to respect and honour all of its parts even though they be different (1 Cor.12:22-26).</p>
<p>The vision of the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Thunder Bay, Ontario, for the Anglican Church of Canada and all of its parts is that there will be love of the other, respect and honour of difference, and that the Anglican Church of Canada will be a light unto people and nations everywhere.</p>
