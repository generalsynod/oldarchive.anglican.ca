	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>The Apostles creed does indeed state the basis of Christian faith, but Andrew what you fail to see is that reciting it week by week is different from living it out. People today want to see it lived not just said, so perhaps we should start to put into practice some of those beliefs first and then we might state the creeds with more power and less hypocrisy.</description>

		<description>&quot;The Apostles&#039; Creed and Nicene Creed served important roles when they were written, but they serve as barriers for people with beliefs more common in this century.&quot;

I really have to take issue with this. I don&#039;t just recite the creed every week because I &quot;enjoy&quot; it, but because I actually believe it. Last time I checked, these two creeds stated the essentials of Christian belief, in the (post)modern world as much as in the ancient one. For us as Anglicans, they form a common basis of doctrine, without which we couldn&#039;t even effectively discuss theological differences with one another. They are simply not optional.</description>
