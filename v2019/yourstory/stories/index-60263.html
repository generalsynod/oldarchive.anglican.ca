				<p align="center"><strong>VISION 2019<br />
THE ANGLICAN PARISH OF CHRIST CHURCH<br />
GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA</strong></p>
<p>On September 13, 2009, worshippers at Christ Church, Grande Prairie, were treated to a PowerPoint presentation on “Paternalism in the Anglican Church”, which was summarized in one sentence:  “Paternalism in the Church is BAD.”  As part of our efforts to take ownership of our own Church, the worshippers then answered these questions:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>In ten years, where would Jesus want this parish to be in terms of<br />
worship,<br />
education,<br />
prayer,<br />
evangelism,<br />
fellowship and<br />
loving service to others?</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>

<p>I pray that the Church build on positive parts of our Church history and open lines of communication with every Anglican.</p>
<p>Lord, may we be more accepting of all faiths.  May we embrace all clergy and become more inviting to fill our Church with fun and fellowship.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>Help us to proclaim Jesus with comfort and certainty.</p>
<p>We pray that we may reach out to those who need our love, care and the good news of Jesus.</p>
<p>Lord, being your followers and children we need to listen to your plea. Help us to hear your voice and to speak your word. Help us tell our stories of our relationship with you so that you may have many more followers. We cannot do this without you Lord. We love you with our whole selves. Protect us from the evils of this world.</p>
<p>Dear Heavenly Father, we pray that you help our church continue to grow in the knowledge of your existence. We ask that you will always be with our parish, and that we may shine in your love.</p>
<p>I pray that our parish will have a larger congregation,</p>
<p>May we have too many volunteers, and be a welcoming place for people from all walks of life.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hear our cry, O Lord,<br />
for the Anglican Church of Canada</strong></p>
<p>Lord, I pray for better communication and education</p>

<p>I pray that the Church build on positive parts of our Church history and open lines of communication with every Anglican.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>O God, who has brought us through many centuries of worship and living our faith, guide and strengthen the Anglican Church of Canada as it moves forward with the new vision you have given. Keep our eyes fixed on you as the perfecter of the vision.</p>
<p>May we move forward in confidence and in your will to a church that celebrates and shares the abundance and blessing of life in you. May we reflect your Son our Saviour, Jesus Christ, in all that we say and do.</p>
<p>Bless the leadership of the Anglican Church of Canada, particularly those involved in education, evangelism, worship, prayer and loving service.</p>
<p>We pray this in Jesus’ name.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hear our cry, O Lord,<br />
for this our parish of Christ Church</strong></p>
<p>Lord, I pray for evangelism in the Church and that we be open to your will.  May we have more fellowship, with social activities, youth groups and more lively music.</p>
<p>Father, may we grow in community and numbers, worship and action, so that a second parish is required in Grande Prairie.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray that in ten years we will have a loving, caring Church with meaningful worship and open to everyone in the community and that our service will be based on faith, love and belief in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray that the people of Christ Church will have the courage to open their hearts and minds to the wondrous plans that God has for our lives, to grow and nurture others, to seek Jesus in all things and to listen for him.</p>
<p>That we remove our egos and work as a whole for God’s will, embracing everyone’s uniqueness.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for better attendance at the Church:  for youth attendance to be large; for better involvement with the community at large.</p>
<p>May the Anglican Church be welcoming to anyone. May we, by the love and respect we have towards each other, show that God lives here.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hear our cry, O Lord,<br />
for the Anglican Church of Canada</strong></p>
<p>May we grow in faith by encouraging individual parishes to do the same.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the Anglican Church of Canada to remember other parishes that are small so not be forgotten.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for priests that need help getting people to come to Church.</p>
<p>Father, may the Anglican Church of Canada be less aloof. May they interact more with all the parishes across Canada from coast to coast.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, please let us be aware of the Church throughout all of Canada, the differences not only in living conditions but also in needs. Let us be better communicators.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray that the Anglican Church will follow the principles and true meanings of the bible as to be more closely in tune with your wishes.</p>
<p>I pray for unity and understanding of different perspectives and ideas- diversity.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hear our cry, O Lord,<br />
for this our parish of Christ Church</strong></p>
<p>Please somehow encourage all Anglicans to return to Christ Church again. The city and surrounding areas of Grande Prairie are full of Anglicans. The Anglican Church has touched many lives and hearts in the past, many have been hurt in one way or another and have stopped attending. Heal their hearts Lord and encourage them to come back to worship at Christ Church.</p>
<p>I pray for new music with up-beat hymns and songs.  May we retain our liturgy but expand our faith.  May the sermons be shortened and message from the scriptures to be in today’s language related to today’s happenings.</p>
<p>I pray for growth, with more community outreach, care for congregation members, children’s programming (Sunday School &amp; nursery).</p>
<p>Lord, I pray that our parish will allow all who attend to be more in-tune with the teachings of Jesus Christ and follow your commandments.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray you watch over our congregation and town of Grande Prairie. I pray you watch over all the sick people in the world and I pray for world peace. Thank you, for blessing us with our minister who is a great preacher. I pray that you please forgive me for my sins and make my heart pure.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hear our cry, O Lord,<br />
for this our parish of Christ Church</strong></p>
<p>Heavenly Father we praise you for your gift of the Church. We know that we do not always live as the Church you created us to be and we are sorry. We claim your mercy as we seek to work out our community faith.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask your wisdom in looking at who we are now and the courage to see who you want us to be.</p>
<p>We ask for your presence and strength as we struggle to share our faith with one another and with those outside our community.</p>
<p>As we move forward, we beg the inspiration and guidance of your Holy Spirit. Open our hearts and minds to see and hear your will for this parish of Christ Church.</p>
<p>Thank you for the great gift of your Son, Jesus through whom we pray.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, please let us become more aware of the needs of others in our community and reach out to them. Let us continue to pray for our Church and its members, remembering that we are all different, have different needs and ways of life. Let us continue to pray for the world and victims of violence.</p>
<p>May we be vibrant with primary, youth and mature groups, making a family atmosphere.</p>
