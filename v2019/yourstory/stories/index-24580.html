	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Elaine Y. has identified the most important issue facing the Anglican Church. 

Will The Anglican Church of Canada in 2019 be the beacon of &quot; The Good News of The Gospel of Christ&quot; as we have known the church to be in our generation? 

I pray it will. 

However, I am concerned the church will not meet that obligation, according to the teachings of the scripture, due to the desire of the leadership of The Anglican Church to accommodate all communities of the population who promote their own agenda in the name of the church. 

&quot;We must not manipulate the interpretation of the scripture to suit our own wants, needs or life style.

We should not allow vocal minority groups to use the church to advance their own agenda or life style.
