				<small>Sent to us on October 1st, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Forgive me if I have a rather negative point of view but I think it needs to be expressed.</p>
<p>I believe that the damage done by the Same Sex Blessing Issue is not repairable.  I don’t believe that there will be an Anglican Church in Canada by 2019.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t mind what people do behind closed doors as long as I am not required to watch or bless it.  I do not hang onto every single word of the Bible literally.  But I do not believe that homosexuality is healthy or God’s will.  However, I realize that there are many many very lonely people in this continent who find companionship and love living with someone of the same sex. If they wish to have that relationship blessed they could have gone to the United Church for that purpose. Perhaps I am wrong and if God finally speaks to me in some way on this divisive topic perhaps I will change my mind. I also abhor the fact that in the past, so many homosexuals have been ostracised, ridiculed, tortured and even murdered.</p>
<p>As I see the situation the whole issue has been a political move to have churches recognise and sanctify these relationships and there-by force governments into giving benefits to partners as if they were spouses.   The church has been manipulated but is blind to the fact.   It seems as if clergy and laity have been exposed to so much propaganda on the issue that they have finally decided that yes, this is indeed God’s will.</p>
<p>Even if it is indeed God’s will to bless and ultimately marry same sex couples, the Anglican Church and Leaders should not have let this become a political football.  This issue has indeed caused the death knell to our church.  The divisions which have then arisen over church ownership are the real problem.  Outsiders see this as a wicked waste of time and energy.  We are seen as hopelessly lost and mired in the mud of disagreement.</p>
<p>So what can we do?</p>
<p>Mend the splits caused by this, allow churches to differ on the issue and allow the “conservative” churches to continue to worship in their buildings and to respect the fact that just possibly they are right in their beliefs.   Leaders  and bishops should practice some humility and find some common ground with those whose opinions differ, i.e. the break away churches etc.  They should respect some of these great pastors even if they can’t agree.</p>
<p>Anglicans have always differed over certain theological matters and then they have agreed to disagree. Eventually, those differences of the past no longer seem to be such huge issues.</p>
<p>I pray to God that bishops will get to the table, respect the opinions of those who do not agree with them, allow the so called “break away” churches to use their buildings and get on with being Christians and work to relieve the suffering and injustices in the world.</p>
<p>As a matter of interest, in our diocese, there are now churches lying empty and abandoned because of the “dog in a manger” attitude of the Anglican Church.</p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>
<p>Jane F.,  Ladysmith,  Diocese of B.C.</p>

					<p><strong>“Where is your church now, and where do you want the Anglican Church of Canada to be by 2019?”</strong></p>
<p>I find this process a real challenge since I prefer to discuss these questions with a small group of different minded people.</p>
<p>That said I don&#8217;t have the time right now to bring together people and submit the results to you, but maybe in time you might consider facilitate focus groups to obtain opinions using this method.</p>
<p>I believe the Anglican Church of Canada represents a wide variety of spiritualities and religious beliefs and this is good since I believe God&#8217;s grace is found in diversity.  However, at the grace roots I don&#8217;t experience the embracing of diversity, tolerance and inclusion.  An example is reflected in the prayers of the people when victims and not assailants are prayed for. What ever happened to the practice of reaching out to our so-called enemies?</p>
<p>In 2019 I want to the Anglican Church of Canada to be in partnership with other faiths, sharing outreach programs, spiritual development programs, worship, and buildings.  I want the church to be more than tolerant of others to the point of embracing, accepting and inclusive.  I want the Anglican Church to be truly representative of the cultural demographics of the locations where there are congregations.  I would like to see the fostering of hospitality, outreach, spiritual development and a sense of compassion for all people.  For too long the church, being the people, has practiced an attitude of take it or leave. In other words if you don&#8217;t like the worship and the program go somewhere else.  I believe this contradicts the Christian mission as I understand it.  I support a concept being put forward by W.Paul Jones in his book The Art of Spiritual Direction: Giving and  Receiving Spiritual Guidance, that placed spiritual direction at the centre of church and faith development.  The sepcific chapter is entitled, &#8220;Spiritual Direction and Church Renewal.&#8221; I like the idea that church renewal requires individual and corporate renewal using the sensitive attention to individual and group spiritual direction.  Worship as I understand it and experience it is group spiritual direction and needs to be planned and facilitated with this in mind.  Worship is not merely a predetermined diet that has no consideration for the unique needs of individuals and groups that make up the church at any given time.  Paul Jones is now a Roman Catholic priest who supports some of the practices and example of John Wesley, which appears to me to be in itself the embracing of diversity, and a willingness to learn from various traditions.</p>
<p>I welcome this opportunity to express these views to you. I wish you well in these endeavours.</p>
<p>Blessings</p>
<p>Peter+</p>

				<small>Sent to us on October 1st, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p align="center">From the young clergy of the Diocese of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island</p>
<p>On Monday, September 28, Bishop Sue Moxley gathered clergy in our diocese under the age of 40 to discuss the questions of the Vision 2019: Where is your church now? Where do you want the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019?</p>
<p align="center">Who are we as Church?</p>
<p>We see our Church as a diverse community where God is present. We are also surrounded by the sacred space of transition and, sometimes, death. We reflected on the image of a person dying, strong in their faith in Jesus Christ, who was so looking forward to their resurrection and the end of pain and confusion. This image was, for us, a metaphor of how we see the Anglican Church of Canada right now.</p>
<p>We see in this image a great deal of hope. We see the youth that are present in our congregations right now while others in our congregations are crying for more youth. We are rich in a diverse tradition of story, theology, liturgy and symbol that others are looking to us to reclaim for themselves. We see the resurrection on the horizon and we move toward it in hope and excitement.</p>
<p>Moving toward this resurrection requires us to let go of things that we are spending too much energy to resuscitate. As human beings, we are seeking <em>homeostasis, </em>a state of continuity with our surroundings. Our buildings, our bureaucracy and our institution are working hard to justify their existence in a time and an age where their effectiveness has long been diminished. We see hope in efforts by congregations and our national church to work with other churches and organizations. Our diocese has a rich tradition of union churches<em>, </em>and our national church is in conversations with our partners in the ELCIC to unite our national efforts. We have long seen church buildings as the fortress of peace and solitude in our communities, and this is the legacy we leave. We talked about our churches being “mission posts”, a place from which we serve and share God&#8217;s love.</p>
<p align="center">Who are the young clergy of the Church?</p>
<p>As those who will be taking the reins in the years leading up to and following 2019, we spent some time reflecting on who we are and what leadership will look like in 2019.</p>
<p>A dozen of us gathered. Four men and eight women. Nine of us in parish ministry, one a hospital chaplain, one a conflict resolution consultant and one seeking a parish. Seven were parents. Four of us are serving in an urban centre, eight of us are serving in small towns and rural areas. We also represent a wide range of liturgical and theological training.</p>
<p>We reflected on the image of a midwife, and see ourselves as the midwives of 2019. We are the ones who will encourage the Church to “push hard” with the alert, “this is going to hurt”.We are journeying with the rest of the church towards a new birth.</p>
<p>We are also struggling. We are burdened with debt from our theological studies and the need to purchase reliable vehicles and acquire a home while supporting families on an income that even the National Student Loan Centre recognizes as too low to even start paying back our student loans.</p>
<p>We are living with the expectations of anxious parishes who have grown accustomed to either single clergy or with a clergy spouse who became a ministry partner.</p>
<p>We recognize the importance of our own wellness in order to live out our vocations not only as priests and deacons, but also as Christians, wives, husbands, daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, friends, fathers and mothers.</p>
<p>We see ourselves in a large, ecumenical, inter-faith picture working with other churches and other organizations to serve the world as God&#8217;s people. We focus on the growth and what is “going right”. We carry with us a few expectations of how things “should be” or how “it has always been”, and seek a vision of hope and justice. We seek co-operation, authenticity, integrity and relationship with God and the world in which we live.</p>
<p align="center">Where do we want to be in 2019?</p>
<p>In our vocations we are blessed daily with encounters of grace. We want to be a church that asks, “How do we celebrate the Spirit of God in and amongst us?”</p>
<p>We will be a different church. And we are comfortable with this. The question is, “How will we change?”</p>
<p>The theme for General Synod 2010, which we look forward to hosting in our diocese, is “Feeling the winds of God—charting a new course.” We want to be a pro-active church that charts it&#8217;s own course, blown by the winds of the Holy Spirit, not waiting for the pressures around us to dictate who we are and what will become of us.</p>
<p>We see the Church as a movement, not an institution, who knows and loves God and itself and shares that love with others, recognizing the grace of God in the holy moments of our encounters with one another and the world around us.</p>
<p>In faith,</p>

					<p><strong>Where my parish is now</strong></p>
<p>Well, up front I should say that I am not a member of an Anglican congregation. I am part of a Lutheran congregation. I am part of Resurrection Lutheran Church in Orleans Ontario.</p>
<p>My congregation had a bit of a relationship with the closest Anglican Parish (St. Helen&#8217;s, Orleans) but that relationship has withered in the 7+ years I have been part of my congregation. We used to worship together every Ash Wednesday. But for our partners that service became their confirmation date which made mutual ministry unworkable. But this was not the basic problem with the relationship between the two parishes.</p>
<p>The main problem was that the relationship was between our called leaders, not the general membership. We didn&#8217;t own the relationship so when there was a pastoral change the relationship withered.</p>
<p><strong>Where I want my parish to be in 2019</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, I want to be part of a faith community which cares more about ministry in this context than worship in any particular tradition.</p>
<p>I imagine that my congregation, the local Anglican parish and the nearest United Church might merge into one faith community celebrating in three worship traditions. I imagine that we might sell our current buildings and build one new facility together. I imagine we would call 3 rostered leaders with complementary gifts. Ideally one from each tradition but typically one strong in counseling, one in family ministry and another in evangelism.</p>
<p>I imagine that we would have 3 worship services on a Sunday.</p>
<p>A 8 am &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; chapel services (heavy on the word, short on music, with a focus on older hymns)</p>
<p>A 9 am &#8220;family&#8221; service which is kid friendly (fewer readings, modern text, shorter, faster songs)</p>
<p>A 11 am service which is the &#8220;full&#8221; deal (a mix of music and the choir, a full service and multiple readings)</p>
<p>I imagine that we would keep the type of service steady but change which faith family leader was responsible for each service time on a monthly rotation. So some members might chose to follow one pastoral leader or tradition by changing when they worship. Others might chose to be loyal to one service time and learn to appreciate all three faith traditions.</p>
<p>I imagine that we might re-purpose our current buildings. The Anglican building might be expanded to accommodate a short term stay hospice and day away program to support those caring for family members with long term care needs like Alzheimer&#8217;s. The Lutheran building might be expanded into a satellite rehabilitation centre so that outpatients do not have to travel back to the hospital for their exercise program and  mini-treatments. The United Church building could be renovated into a Active Seniors centre which promotes, enhance and support the well-being, independence and zest for living of both seniors and of adults with physical disabilities (see <a href="http://www.thegoodcompanions.ca/">http://www.thegoodcompanions.ca</a> for an existing program in downtown Ottawa).</p>
<p>I would like to see us located in the proposed future business park in the centre of this suburb. I imagine that we would give the city the long term right to use the church parking lot as overflow parking for the nearby transit hub station in return for a low cost for the land. We would also commit to maintain public green space around the building site. Here is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=103454623408522701142.000474d801d5fc2fedeb5&ll=45.480611,-75.519955&spn=0.008305,0.022724&z=16">Google Map</a> of the location:</p>
<p>I want the faith community site to become a hub of helping organizations in this community. So I want people to come to the site for a variety of reasons other than worship (at first) and then grow into a faith relationship with us.</p>
<p>So in 2019, I want to see an annual report that reads something like this:</p>
<p>Well, it has been a busy year here at Signs of Hope.</p>
<p>The Signs of Hope foundation has continued to develop the main building. The new computer lab is now up and running. It is appreciated by the ESL classes and youth employment bureau during the mornings / evenings and the homework club in the afternoons. The big project for the coming year is the scent garden running from the bus terminal to the overflow parking here at the church. This fully wheelchair accessible path with plantings in raised beds will be a delight to those walking through our property as well as those looking for a quiet sanctuary.</p>
<p>The Faith In Action team continues to try and get all members of the community to participate in at least one mission event each year. This year, there were a total of 17 different mini-events or activities.</p>
<p>The faith development team has reported to the 3 church councils on the results of our 5th anniversary membership survey.</p>
<p>Most members from each of the 3 founding congregations (Orleans United, Resurrection Lutheran and St. Helen&#8217;s Anglican) seem to have found a home in the new combined faith community. However, even after 5 years, some people are frustrated by the rotation of the services types through the service times. A few people have said that they have arrived at the building, discovered that they were there at the wrong time for their faith background so they went home. A few mentioned that they dislike the contemporary service even when it is in the style of &#8220;their&#8221; tradition.</p>
<p>Members who have joined the new combined community have less dissatisfaction with the rotating schedule because they typically chose a specific worship time and worship in each tradition in its turn. However, some members have mentioned that it is hard to get to know those members who wander in and out as they follow the service traditions. Several people mentioned that it is hard sometimes to know who is a member and who is a visitor.</p>
<p>A number of newer members mentioned that they don&#8217;t identify with any one of the founding faith communities. So they don&#8217;t quite know where they belong. Additionally our set-up means we expect people to belong to one (and only one) of the 3 churches to be consider eligible for voting at annual meetings.</p>
<p>The Worship team would like funding and pastoral time to run a mid-week service at 7 pm on Wednesday. This will be a contemporary service which will have a less formal structure. The primary &#8220;audience&#8221; for this service is young urban professionals who are not willing to commit to Sunday morning services.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Miranda G.</p>

					<p>My vision for the church in 2019 is that we will actually have a vision &#8211; a shared sense of what our common life and mission is about.</p>
<p>To get there will take work. In terms of church politics, we will have to &#8220;turn our swords into ploughshares&#8221; &#8211; stop fighting the win-lose battles, and start cultivating the ground for agreement in mission. We will have to stop claiming that the things that matter most are the things that are pushing others out of the church altogether. Maybe the only way to do that is to lock some of us in a (figurative) room long enough, until the war stops, and we rediscover our shared heart for the good news.</p>
<p>In real life, that can probably happen with some combination of theological conversation, shared experience &#8211; and unceasing prayer. I can picture a domestic version of &#8220;Volunteers in Mission&#8221; that helps rural and urban, eastern and western, northern and southern, social-gospel and evangelical, discover some of each other&#8217;s true devotion and service.</p>
<p>On a broader canvas, I look forward to hearing more, more directly, about what is happening in parishes across the country, both in church and out of it. The &#8220;Amazing Grace&#8221; project and this one are just the beginning. New technology really is giving people a voice, but there are still voices going unheard and unsought. We can change that. When we actually know what God is doing through our neighbours in the rest of the church, we can start learning to respect and celebrate it.</p>
<p>But there is also a role for national voices who can piece together what local churches are saying, and shape it into a form that can be offered back to the church as a way of capturing our shared vision. We need that, in part, so that we can actually operate as a national church, having something to say and something to offer to our country and to the world. But we also need to re-express our Canadian Anglican identity in a way that gives courage and confidence back to local churches &#8211; so that each of us knows it matters to the rest of us, that our particular church is where it is, doing God&#8217;s work in our own setting.</p>
<p>Over the next 10 years, I hope someone or some group will puzzle out that picture. Maybe it will turn into a new kind of mission statement &#8211; one that includes the realities of what God is actually doing in our midst, along with our sense of what we might be missing. Maybe it will be a story about Christ crucifed and risen, a story that is reflected in the many stories of the Anglican church across Canada. But we need some way of recognizing in ourselves, as a whole church in so many different expressions, the desire to &#8220;know Christ, and the power of his resurrection, and the sharing of his sufferings.&#8221;</p>

					<p>I believe that the Anglicans must socialize with the other Christians of the town. Avoid being exclusive like a private club.</p>
<p>In Fort Macleod there are six Christian congregations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alliance and Missionary</li>
<li>Anglican</li>
<li>Netherland Reform</li>
<li>Roman Catholic</li>
<li>United Church</li>
<li>Victory/Pentecostal</li>
</ul>
<p>Three of the five have seasonal, fund raising meals.</p>
<p>Only a handful of Anglicans are ambitious enough to attend and support the &#8220;socials&#8221; hosted by the Roman Catholics and the United Church!</p>
<p>The Anglicans cannot expect the Catholics and United to attend Anglican teas and suppers if they do not reciprocate!</p>

					<p><strong>Where is our Church now?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The community in which I serve does not ‘fit’ neatly with readily accepted standards for</p>
<p>viability and ‘success’.  St. Mark’s is a “family” church, with attendance on any given Sunday somewhere between 40+ to 80 or so.  The parish consists of 3 buildings:  a Church, a Hall and a Rectory – all within a half-acre lot in the north end of Saskatoon.</p>
<p>Worship space is small – 95 bodies in the pews would be a full house.  The small white frame building looks like a ‘country church’ in the city.  But make no mistake.  These</p>
<p>old and inadequate buildings are NOT the church.   The people are!  And what a remarkable group of folks they are.   Predominantly ‘gray’, like so many other Anglican</p>
<p>congregations.  But there are 7 or 8 young families and a growing group of babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers.  A Kids Corner has been carved out in the worship space to</p>
<p>enable the little ones to be themselves in our midst.  Worship is characterized by informality and reverence, innovation and variety.  Music is led by piano, keyboard,</p>
<p>&amp; flute.  St. Mark’s folks tend to be joyful, thoughtful, open and accepting of all who come through our doors.  Mission includes PWRDF, local initiatives, and involves</p>
<p>both budgeted funds as well as special givings for particular projects.  One visitor</p>
<p>described St. Mark’s as “<em>the</em> <em>little church that could”.</em></p>
<p>The community is currently wrestling with what its future will look like.  Our old buildings no longer meet needs adequately.  Changes are inevitable and this both excites and frightens us.  The ‘shadow’ that we live with as a community is complacency.  We like who we are and how we do things.  Yet we respond well to challenge and change.</p>
<p>Finances have thus far been solid and stable.  Strong prayer ministry undergirds our</p>
<p>common life.  The next ten years will see St. Mark’s celebrate a centenary and most likely</p>
<p>undergo significant changes.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>My Vision of the Church in 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I dream of a Church that will have arrived at a place of peace within its own ‘skin’ – always testing itself against the teachings of Jesus Christ, but confident</p>
<p>and committed in its Mission to respond to the needs of the world in loving service.</p>
<p>I dream of a Church that finds its identity best lived out at the local level – in the places where people gather and where their needs &amp; hopes intersect.</p>
<p>I dream of a Church that is characterized more by mutuality than by hierarchy;</p>
<p>where tradition is honored  for its beauty and timelessness ;  where innovation is</p>
<p>celebrated and welcomed as the winds of God move in this time and place.</p>
<p>I dream of a Church where all people, regardless of gender, age, race,</p>
<p>sexual orientation, or theological persuasion, may engage freely and fully in</p>
<p>the life and witness to which God calls us.</p>
<p>I dream of a Church that will have divested itself of many buildings, and discovered creative new ways to ‘be’ Church in both urban &amp; rural settings.</p>
<p>I dream of a Church where leadership Teams may enable a fuller sharing of gifts – both lay and ordained, and more effectively serve the needs of local areas &amp; specific communities.</p>
<p>I dream of a Church where joy and commitment to a shared vision will so</p>
<p>permeate our life, that the fear, mistrust and ‘protectionism’ that plague us now, will be dissolved in a new spirit of radical cooperation, respect and mission.</p>
<p>I dream that God will raise up prophetic voices amongst us, to call us forward</p>
<p>to the hard and holy work of living, serving and witnessing  TOGETHER as</p>
<p>the Body of Christ in Canada during these early years of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p>I dream…………….</p>

					<p>Excerpt from a homily for Trinity Sunday, June 7, 2009</p>
<p>Today, in the Anglican Church of Canada, we also celebrate ‘Vision 2019&#8242; Sunday, and we recall that the reason our Church can and does look forward is based in our faith in this Trinity.</p>
<p>Today we are reminded that this Church of ours EXISTS for mission, and so we recommit ourselves to living out the five marks of mission &#8211; proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom; teaching, baptising and nurturing new believers; responding to human need by loving service; seeking to transform unjust structures, and striving to safeguard the integrity of creation and renew the life of the earth. And today we also are invited to join in sharing our vision for the future of our church, to look forward to 2019. There will be future opportunities for you to do just that, but it would not be fair, realistic or helpful to ask for hasty response. It is only fair that as I invite you to share your vision, I share mine with you. As Isaiah’s prophetic ministry was shaped by his vision as told in our first lesson, I strive to shape by ministry according to my vision as well.</p>
<p>This is my vision for this Anglican Church of Canada, for this diocese, this parish, this congregation and each person here.</p>
<p>My vision is of a people who take seriously our baptismal commitment to worship, to pray, to study scripture, to grow in faith and to keep repenting each and every time we mess up.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church where buildings and furniture are cared for so that they are useful, adapted as needed, and never becomes shrines in themselves.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church where ecumenical involvement is taken seriously by ALL of us, because it is ONLY together that we can truly witness to and serve our communities.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church that does not see stewardship as just another campaign to squeeze more money out of reluctant members, but as a joyful, generous response of thanksgiving and faith that makes us WANT to give more and serve more for the purposes of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church were each congregation takes seriously its relationship to the wider church and particularly the Anglican communion, recognizing a person in another congregation in our parish, in Kingston, in B.C., in Iqaluit or in Nigeria as part of OUR church.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church that remembers that its roots are not in some strict doctrinal confession &#8211; that we have a long tradition of NOT trying to define too closely our theology and practice, a tradition of avoiding excluding those with whom we are not in complete agreement, of willingness to do the hard work of listening to voices that differ, of exploring the edges of faith and being willing to live with uncertainty and incompleteness because, after all, we are human and fallible.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church that values the different and indispensable ministries of bishops, priests, deacons and ALL the laity; and seeks to teach, support and empower all to do THEIR ministry.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church that remembers the centrality of worship in forming and nourishing us, and seeks to always balance the unity and diversity of our worship experience, the importance of tradition and the need for full accessibility and participation; and which gives liturgy the attention and resources it deserves.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church that always remembers that we EXIST for mission and seeks to genuinely DO that &#8211; locally and globally.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church that is committed, not just to the care of God’s people, but to care for all creation.</p>
<p>My vision is of a church where anyone &#8211; an African with poor English language skills; Aboriginal brothers and sisters; a scruffy street person; a noticeably, disturbingly, mentally ill individual; a gay or lesbian couple; your cousin you haven’t spoken to in years; your most annoying neighbours &#8211; be they young or old, rich or poor, educated or illiterate; will be recognized for the unique Image of God that is THEM; where they are offered true hospitality &#8211; feeling fully welcomed, included and served by the sacraments and ministries of the church &#8211; whether they can come through our doors or we have to reach out to them.</p>
<p>SHOULD this be where the Anglican Church of Canada is in 10 years? This is just MY vision, and the future of the church needs much more than that. It needs all of us bringing our visions, shaped by our unique backgrounds and perspectives and sharing with each other in ways that allow the Spirit to shape the result.</p>
<p>But the certainty is that without dream or vision, without sharing with and hearing from each other, without openness to the leading of the Holy Spirit, we will be lost.</p>
<p>Dream, Baby Dream!</p>

					<p>I asked parishioners at St. Stephen&#8217;s, Ottawa, to comment on the 5 marks of mission in terms of where we the church are now and where they&#8217;d like it to be in 2019. I didn&#8217;t get many responses but the following is what was written:</p>
<p><em>Mark 1. To proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to see our Church Army have more prominence in our Anglican Church. Anglican Church do more with other churches. We do some now through World Council of Churches, Women&#8217;s Interchurch Council, Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, West End Chaplaincy, i.e. choirs together to raise money, etc. We could do much more together. Maybe there are other joint activities that could be mentioned in the Lenten Calendar?? I&#8217;m glad Church Army is working with Billy Graham people.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Mark 2. To teach, baptize, nurture new believers.</em></p>
<p>No comments.</p>
<p><em>Mark 3. To respond to human need by loving service.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;E.C. Ca Human Take This Bread&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to reach out much more to people of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">different religions</span>. There is only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one God</span>. We need to &#8216;go forth and be the church in the world&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Poverty</span> in Canada <span style="text-decoration: underline;">continues</span> to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">increase</span>. Christ&#8217;s example is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCREAMING</span> at His followers to DO as He DID. When is the Anglican Church going to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Mark 4. To seek to transform unjust structures of society.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;The Anglican Church needs to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">revisit earlier efforts</span> made to look at our &#8216;faith and cultural diversity&#8217; in Canada. This <span style="text-decoration: underline;">includes</span> our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">outstanding</span> failure at honouring the humanity of our Aboriginal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">brothers</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sisters</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read Bishop Eric Bays book &#8216;Another Picture.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to rethink our Justice System&#8230;More to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">prevent</span> crime and more Restorative Justice.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Mark 5. To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation and sustain and renew the life of the earth.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;We need to encourage more reuse, recycle and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">use</span> less. We are a very wasteful society.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish there had been more response but this didn&#8217;t seem to engage people.</p>
