	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>It is encouraging to see youth being concerned about the Faith.  The idea of the Church being “open” or “inclusive” is one that we must be exceedingly clear about so that everyone understands exactly what Jesus commissions us to do.

The Church that Jesus created is “Catholic”, meaning anyone can join.  But there is a catch.  Jesus always challenges us to change ourselves so that we move closer to God.  Never does Jesus give us permission to change God to better suit us.  Thus, the Church is a place where all people are welcome and encouraged to “give up your sinful ways and follow (God)”.  Make no mistake about it.  Church is not, and never has been, a place where you could come as you are and continue sinning as though everything is ok.  Church is a place where sinners can, and are encouraged to, repent and give up their sinful ways.</description>

		<description>Thank you all for sharing your vision(s) of the Church. The message came through loud and clear that you are challenging us all to be more open. I hope we have the courage to listen.

Thank You,
