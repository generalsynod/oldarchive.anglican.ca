	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>I believe what Jenna has said is indeed true.  The ACoC is quickly replacing the gospel with &quot;political correctness&quot; and neither the Primate or the House of Bishops seem to be ready to deal with this fatal disease.  Apostate bishops that deny the uniqueness of Jesus Christ and place all religions on the same level need to be removed from office.  True Anglican accept the authority of Scripture and the uniqueness of Jesus Christ.  &quot;I am the Way, the Truth and the Life . . .&quot;</description>

		<description>Anglicans do not hear the Gospel message? That may be so in Jenna&#039;s parish in Burlington, but it is not true about Anglicans in general. The church that Jenna envisions has been around since 1549, when Cranmer wrote the Prayer Book. What Jenna propounds is a Calvinistic approach, focus on the words of the Gospel and not the intent. Our model is Jesus Christ who called us to love God and our neighbours, and that means seeking justice for all. And please note Jenna that it is Jesus, not the Bible, that is the Word of God.

As for Brian&#039;s response with its suggestion that we should give prizes for Bible Verse Memorization - does he know that even the Devil can quote scripture. It&#039;s meaning less to know what the words are if one is not acting on the instruction. Better to give Sunday Scholl students prizes for examples of ways in which they can put the Gospel into action! Moreover, Brian seems unaware that our Primate is in contact with media and politicians, propounding the message of the Gospel!

		<description>This contribution correctly speaks to some current weaknesses in the Anglican CHurch of Canada. Can you imagine a study bible being published for our denomination, the way that a Lutheran oriented one is currently being prepared?
https://www.cph.org/cphstore/pages/resources/tlsb/
Can you imagine &quot;The Primate&#039;s Bible Memorization Challenge Award&quot; given to the church whose Sunday School students learn the most verses? Can you dream of the Primate preaching an entire sermon that is only Scriptural exposition, without reference to the state of the church? 
Can you imagine all clergy being called to give an &quot;altar call&quot; to the congregation, inviting sinners to repent -- call it &quot;Conversion Sunday.&quot; 
Dream this dream... The Primate calls for Anglicans to write to politicians, radio show hosts and media columnists to help them understand the Christian understanding of Christmas -- That &quot;God Saves&quot; is with us, and that Santa Claus is a lie. Call it the Incarnational Initiative.

Good note there Doug. I concur!</description>
