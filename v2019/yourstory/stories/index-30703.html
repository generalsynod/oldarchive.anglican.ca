	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>What pessimism!!! Not what I would want or expect from a current and future leader in our Church. It shows a lack of trust in the Lord. There are some good hopes for the future (true care for homeless and poor, reading and working knowledge of the Bible). However, it appears instead this individual has brought their sense of ‘victimhood’ to their ministry; clouding a true reading of Holy Scripture. Victims read the Bible with an agenda already present to warp the Word of God. Although I will never say there are not victims of great wrongs, however, those who do not move beyond this view of themselves (and others) are those who are allowing themselves to be, or those who have not discovered true healing through forgiveness as Christ requires. Sadly this individual’s pessimism is not what the future of our Church needs. Our future as Christians needs to start with an understanding that God does have expectations of us, which means there is some ‘right and wrong’. And when we fail, we need to pray for forgiveness to God from the Bible, not to ‘whom it may concern” with the “I’m OK, your OK” view of Scripture.</description>

		<description>I trust her lack of hope is well fulfilled, as the idea of blessing and marrying gay and lesbian people has no support in Scripture. Of course they are welcome in the church - all sinners are. Jesus said, &quot;Go and sin no more.&quot; Gays and lesbians in the Anglican Church of Canada need to live holy lives of celibacy.
The first work of the church is to proclaim the majesty of Christ, and his work upon the cross to redeem sinners, not to care for marginalized in society.</description>

		<description>The problem in the ACoC has little to do with the attitude of males, bishops or otherwise, towards women.  Tragically many have been led down the garden path into apostasy by what I would describe as frivolous claims such as those by this priest.  My question to her would be whether she is committed to the vows she made at her ordination.  If so, she should join those who are committed to genuine orthodoxy and not be taken in by what might be called &quot;politically correct&quot; arguments.  To be a true Anglican one must first be a committed Christian and that means accepting the authority of Scripture and the uniqueness of Jesus Christ.  Failure to do so means you are no longer an Anglican and NOT a Christian.</description>
