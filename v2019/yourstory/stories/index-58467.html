	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>I find this an amazing piece of writing, not only because it is there, but that so many parishioners were able to write. I work in Adult Literacy and wonder how many didn&#039;t put a sheet on the offering plate because they cannot write.  Perhaps a short small group &#039;round table&#039; discussion could capture those people&#039;s feelings and prayers, with someone else writing them down. No identifying that the person can&#039;t write, but collecting a few thoughts as well.</description>

		<description>Hi there.

Sorry you had problems viewing this entry.  There is a link to the Flckr feed to view each entry on its own, but in case it is missed, here it is:

We want to have these all transcribed into text, but we can only do it as we have time, and will not happen as quickly as we would like.

Do not hesitate to contact us directly at vision2019@national.anglican.ca, here on the blog, or using the Feedback tab if you have any other questions or comments.
