	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Hello Joan.. I&#039;m neither young or old in the Anglican Church, but I find the services that feel like a concert are not what I want either.  I struggle with the music that is repetitive or set at such a high setting that I can&#039;t reach those repetitive words.  I want liturgy - the work of the Church - the work of the day.  I want readings read by my pew mates and Eucharist served by those I care about.  I want services from the book (either BCP or BAS), not printed on a sheet.  I want the notes (music) to the songs I am singing so at least I can figure out of I&#039;m going up or down.I like guitar and flute and even banjo sometimes, but I want organ, too.  Enough?  I could go on forever.  I&#039;ll watch for a reply...</description>
