	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Bishop Kerr-Wilson!

I can think of no one else more suitable to carry the torch of our beloved St. Peter!  It&#039;s been 8 years of me in the wilderness, and I thought I&#039;d drop you a line to say hello!  Since I left the Church, the world has been a difficult place through which to navigate.  As my 37th year approaches, I still find myself here.

I wish you and your beloved family all the best in the years to come.

Remember me in your prayers, 

Former Postulant, 

Richard Karl McGurk</description>

		<description>Bravo for the parish! This, of course, isn&#039;t anything new; the real work of the church has always been at the local level. Sometimes, though, the national church and dioceses seem to forget that the church is based around people rather than institutions. One of the major strengths of the Anglican church is that it has a presence in practically every community in the country. It would really be a pity to lose this by closing all of our small churches, as seems to be the current trend. There has been much lamentation of late about the demise of the local community; the church certainly has something to demonstrate to the world here, by showing how to be part of the Body of Christ.

Incidentally, there was a show that aired on CBC Radio&#039;s Ideas a couple of years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theologyphilosophycentre.co.uk/news/2007/06/on_radical_orthodoxy.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;On Radical Orthodoxy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, that did an excellent job of discussing the role of the parish in the contemporary world (among other things, such as the importance of liturgy). Definitely worth listening to.</description>
