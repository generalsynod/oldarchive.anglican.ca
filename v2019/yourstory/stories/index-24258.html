					<p>Before you ask, &#8220;Where is our church now?&#8221; It should be prefaced with a question as it was asked over 65 years ago when the church faced similar challenges:  &#8221;Who is Jesus Christ for us today?&#8221;  Deitrich Bonhoeff (1941?)  The question remains applicable, now, as was then.</p>

					<p>I have hope that our Primate has the spiritual depth and the energy to implement the vital changes I am looking for.</p>
<p>I have worked as a consultant in Anglican Dioceses in several parts of the world. In only four of these dioceses have I noticed and been shown a special aliveness.</p>
<p>This special aliveness was only present when the Bishop in each of these four dioceses trusted and cared for his/her clergy &#8216;in the trenches&#8217;  of parish ministry as the A#1 priority. This commitment included the Bishop being vulnerable and risking in relationships with the clergy, and, not expecting clergy to trust their Bishop <em>a priori</em>. To be precise, it was the Bishop who took the first risk of being vulnerable, who offered trust to the clergy. Usually, it seems that the Bishop expects to be trusted and respected, but offers nothing personal to initiate the relationship.  Perhaps the present crisis of falling numbers, deficit financing, and</p>
<p>in some dioceses, pervasive anxiety among clergy, will bring out the best in some of today&#8217;s bishops.  The four bishops I alluded to above all had to pastor clergy who struggled with multi-point parishes, large geographic areas to serve, and, very very tight diocesan finances. The moral and trust was high. What a privilege to meet those four bishops!</p>
<p>The CEO-fund raiser-government-administrator bishop is not only an oxymoron but has, perhaps unwittingly, put power and position ahead of  the primary pastoral calling.  So many lay people are deprived of leadership in finance, management, program, and true responsibility because the bishop attends so many committees, chairs even more, and is a signatory on the diocesan cheque book. Admittedly, too many lay folk acquiesce to the style of a bishop who likes to be in charge.</p>
<p>My vision for 2019 includes a Church that will take the risk of calling men and women to the Episcopacy who are willing and able to trust and care for their parish clergy in action and in heart. A bishop who leads clergy with trust and care will be living Paul&#8217;s great description of Christ in Philippians 2 &#8211; the servant.  This goes hand in hand with trusting capable lay members to run the &#8216;business&#8217; of church &#8211; and leaving them to it. Yes this Vision will cause an upheaval: but what better time than now to transform the ethos of our Church when we are at a crisis point?</p>
<p>Blessings</p>

				<small>Sunday, August 23rd, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The front page of our weekly parish bulletin proclaims our Mission Statement: &#8220;We are a people of God, followers of Jesus, open to the Spirit&#8221;, and the back page declares, &#8220;The service of the church into the world &#8211; begins again this week.&#8221;  Rooted and grounded in the Triune God, we commit to a continuing mission to and presence in the world. I think this is a good place for us to be now, and ten years from now.  Yet, I need to examine what we mean by our statement, and especially what we mean by &#8220;open.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one important sense, this openness signifies an advance within our parish, which has sometimes, partly because of our smallness and survival instinct, been inclined to keep to ourselves, with the occasional charitable outreach around Thanksgiving or Christmas. During the past few years, we have acquired a community presence, all the more remarkable considering our lack of a physical building to call our own.  Our people are our presence. Our task when we do find a suitable property will be to hold on to this archetypal church, &#8220;a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&#8221; [IICor.5:1] Meanwhile, we are seen to exist and to serve, demonstrating that, in the words of our Newsletter editor, &#8220;We would like to have a contagious faith that will influence and encourage our entire community, one life at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>But our web-page, after repeating the Mission Statement, attempts to welcome by assuring ourselves and others that &#8220;we are an inclusive community of open-minded, fun-loving, Christian families and individuals.&#8221;  We use the word &#8220;community&#8221; in three different senses: the specific parish community, the local and global secular community, and the worldwide Christian community, especially but not exclusively the Anglican communion.</p>
<p>We need to take care that in opening one door, we do not allow another to blow shut. In our eagerness to be open-minded and fun-loving, are we in danger of rejecting our communal memory, theology and tradition? The Book of Common Prayer is still authorized for use throughout the Church. Yet we use it only one Sunday per month, at an early morning service &#8211; much better than never, as in some parishes, but not often enough. The Anglican liturgy is one of the living glories of world culture; we should nourish it, practise it and share it.</p>
<p>When we open our doors and arms to people who have been scorned by church and society, do we impatiently shut out those of our communion/community who continue to struggle with the implications of such openness in the light of Scriptural tradition? Do we let one issue or cause blow everything else off the table?</p>
<p>As we look towards 2019, let us open all our doors, taking time to find doorstops so that none slam shut, understanding that some of the gusts may be overpowering and that members of the Community will need to shelter and comfort one another. Let&#8217;s continue to go out, through the open doors, taking &#8220;the service of the church into the world&#8221;, engaging in the complicated and heartbreaking search for peace and social justice. Let&#8217;s be ever more &#8220;open-minded&#8221; and ready to explore communities beyond our cultural and spiritual borders. In the words of T.S. Eliot in &#8220;Little Gidding&#8221;: &#8220;We shall not cease from exploration.&#8221; But we must remain &#8220;a people of God, followers of Jesus, open to the Spirit,&#8221; a community with both a past and a future. So, as Eliot continues: &#8220;the end of all our exploring/ Will be to arrive where we started/ And to know the place for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I recently read &#8220;Communion, Covenant and our Anglican Future: Reflections of the Episcopal Church&#8217;s 2009 Convention from the Archbishop of Canterbury for the Bishops, Clergy and Faithful of the Anglican Communion.&#8221; <a href="http://www.aco.org/acns/news.cfm/2009/7/28/ACNS4641">http://www.aco.org/acns/news.cfm/2009/7/28/ACNS4641</a> I re-read  &#8221;Statement of Anglican Primates of the Doctrine of God; Report of the Meeting of Primates of the Anglican Communion: Appendix II. &#8220;17 April 2002. <a href="http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2002/4/17/ACNS2960">http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2002/4/17/ACNS2960</a></p>

					<p>1. The church today:  seems to have lost its focus on &#8216;Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and Love your neighbour as yourself&#8217;. It is fractured, focused on issues such as same-sex blessings, still divided over BCP or BAS, so many more things divide rather than unite. The average age is 70 and rising, the young people few and far between. The BAS which, 20 years ago, was considered a contemporary service is now out-dated, and too rigid a liturgy for today&#8217;s youth.</p>
<p>2. The Anglican church in 2019: I would like to see it out of the big buildings and completely in home churches, small groups gathering regularly for prayer, worship, and discussion. The big buildings would be sold off or used for concerts, large group meetings, conferences etc.. Those buildings take a huge percentage of our income to maintain, money which should go into Outreach, to nurture and assist the marginalized, i.e. to truly act the gospel.</p>
<p>Blessings,</p>

					<p>The whole question is interesting, the fact that it is even being asked, that is. First, I perceive my parish to be like most in the &#8216;developed&#8217; portion of the ACC: struggling to stay in the black and attract new members fast enough to replace those who die. But the real answer is not about the money or the  people but the disinterest in personal spiritual growth. We are complacent in our faith, not wanting to be challenged or disturbed and certainly not willing to live it deeply and ostentatiously.</p>
<p>Second, I am aware that most Canadian Anglicans want 3 things for the Church: more people, more youth and more money (John Steele, our rector and a member of COGS, preached on this recently). My immediate reaction was that these are completely the wrong things to aspire to as a church for this is to get the cart before the horse. We <strong>should </strong>want a deeper  understanding of Christ and a fervent desire to spread the Good News. The other things would naturally follow as the cart follows the horse.  The job of leadership at all levels is to inspire a hunger for the word, to disturb us from our complacent, comfortable pews, to guide us to want to know God better! I pray for this daily, fervently and corporately.</p>
<p>Christ didn&#8217;t come to make things easy for us.  Forget the $$s and get to work on the souls!</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>We have a comprehensive website which describes what our parish is about at:</p>
<p><a href="http://CowichanStationChurch.CA">CowichanStationChurch.CA</a></p>
<p>I will paste in some portions below which give a quick overview of us and our life as community:</p>
<p>We wish to maintain and grow a church family with worship and ministry based on the Anglican tradition and on current, progressive thinking. To do this, we welcome and minister to all members of our rural community, both within and outside the church and we work with our neighbours to centre and strengthen that community.</p>
<p>We also reach out to a wider, local area and worldwide to assist those in need.</p>
<p>By calling ourselves &#8220;Progressive Christians&#8221;, we mean that . . . . .</p>
<p>1. . . . we have found an approach to God through the life and teachings of Jesus.<br />
2. . . . we recognize the faithfulness of other people who have other names for the way to God&#8217;s realm, and acknowledge that their ways are true for them, as our ways are true for us.<br />
3. . . . we embrace the freedom and responsibility to examine traditional Christian practices and beliefs acknowledging the human construction of religion, draw from diverse sources of wisdom and in the light of conscience and contemporary learning, adjust our views and practices accordingly.<br />
4. . . . we centre our faith on values that affirm the sacredness and interconnectedness of all life, the inherent and equal worth of all persons, and the supremacy of love expressed actively in our lives as compassion and social justice.<br />
5. . . . we find more meaning in searching for understanding than believing in dogmatic certainty &#8211; more value in questioning than in absolutes.<br />
6. . . . we form ourselves into communities dedicated to equipping one another for the work we feel called to do: striving for peace and equality among all people, protecting and restoring the integrity of all God&#8217;s creation.<br />
7. . . . we invite all people to participate in our community and worship life without insisting that they become like us (including but not limited to): believers, agnostics, conventional Christians and questioning skeptics, women, men and those of all sexual orientations and gender identities, people of all races, cultures, classes and abilities, those who hope for a better world and those who have lost hope.<br />
8. . . . we recognize that being followers of Jesus is costly and entails selfless love, conscientious resistance to evil and renunciation of privilege yet we commit to journeying together regardless. We will do our best to ensure that our ongoing growth is characterized by honesty, integrity, openness, respect, intellectual rigor, courage, creativity, and balance.</p>
<p>Thank you for giving us, and me personally, a chance to share our ideas and hopes.</p>
<p>I would like to see the ACC reduce the current bureaucracy by at least 1, maybe 2 levels and increase its existing inclusivity. It would be wonderful if our parish could co-exist with those who have formed the ANIC in communion.</p>

					<p>Stop spending time on same-sex issues, move on to social justice issues. Please God, by 2019!</p>
<p>Weekends are now full-time working days, we don&#8217;t have a time to rest, as God did on the seventh day &#8211; other faiths are more committed to their sabbaths.</p>
<p>We do not yet live a sufficiently alternate life-style so that we can be any kind of example. By 2019 we should not have as many large church buildings as now.</p>
<p>To become good stewards of energy such as heat pumps and solar panels in churches. We are well involved in local initiatives in Christ&#8217;s name, but we don&#8217;t focus much on the millennial goals internationally. We focus on homelessness locally. We may be entering another significant change in Christian history as has happened before.</p>
<p>The church could be the agent that brings to people&#8217;s attention the need for justice rather than self-interest &#8211; rather than expecting that we will solve the problems the church become the symbol of that justice basic to solving the problems of economics and climate change.</p>
<p>Our thanks to the Primate for having put this program in place.</p>
