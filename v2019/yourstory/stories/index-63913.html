					<p><strong>“Where is your church now?”</strong></p>
<p>I am an Anglican priest who has been serving for the past twenty years as a military chaplain, and I am so grateful for our Church’s involvement in, and support for, this unique and vital ministry. Our sailors, and soldiers and air personnel face many challenges as they attend to their duties in defending Canada. They and their families deserve the very best spiritual support we are able to offer them, and our Church has an important role to play in providing that support. At present, Anglican chaplains make up about twenty-two percent of Canadian Forces Chaplaincy, with approximately seventy-five of us Anglican clergy serving in the Regular and Reserve Forces, alongside our colleagues from more than a dozen different Christian denominations, and together with Jewish and Muslim chaplains as well.</p>
<p>All of our military chaplains, regardless of what faith tradition they come from, are expected to be able to provide a comprehensive ministry for the diversity of military personnel and families entrusted to their care. This unique approach to Chaplaincy in the Canadian Forces has led to the continuing development of a truly a multi-faith approach to ministry, which is focused on “ministering to our own, facilitating the worship of others, and caring for all.” As a result of this the CF Chaplaincy is becoming recognized throughout the world for its ecumenical and interfaith approaches to ministry within a pluralistic military environment.</p>
<p>In order for any our chaplains to be truly effective within this ecumenical and multi-faith ministry context, it is essential that they remain thoroughly grounded in, and well connected to, their own religious traditions and faith communities. Key to this for those of us who are Anglican Chaplains is the ministry of our Bishop Ordinary. The Bishop is kind of like a chaplain to the chaplains, and a chief pastor to the Anglican service men and women and their families. The Bishop prays for us, visits us, and cares for us pastorally and spiritually, and also keeps us well grounded within, and sustained by, our Anglican tradition. The Bishop represents the wider church to us, and of equal importance also represents us, and our stories, within the life and witness of the wider church.</p>
<p><strong>“Where do you want the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019?”</strong></p>
<p>As a military chaplain I have too often served in operational contexts where religious forces &#8212; either through complicity or complacency &#8212; have contributed (if even unwittingly) to the repression of their own people, or to the persecution of others. I have witnessed the consequences of religious extremism and intolerance, and have seen some of the malevolence that can be perpetrated in the pursuit of righteousness. It is my hope for the future of our Church, therefore, that we would seek continually to become a more effective force for healing and reconciliation within our own communities, and within our world, which desperately needs such humble witness and faithful service.</p>
<p>It is my sense that Jesus sought, throughout his ministry, to break down the barriers that separate us from one another, and from God, and I believe that he calls us to do likewise. The Apostle Paul, at many points in his writings, holds up for us an image of the Church as a model of reconciliation. Paul was convinced that in Christ all ethnic and racial distinctions had become obliterated, and by extension, all gender and social distinctions as well. In Christ a new humanity is created, one that is characterized by peace and reconciliation. Christ sought to move the &#8220;aliens&#8221; and &#8220;strangers&#8221; from the fringes of society into the inner circle, and not in order to displace those already in the inner circle, but that all might be one, together. Christ welcomed everyone into the household of God, but all too often, we appear to have forgotten these principles, and seem instead to be hard at work redefining “aliens” and “strangers”, and building new walls designed to separate and exclude.</p>
<p>My vision for the church in 2019, therefore, is that we would become a broader, and more welcoming and hope-filled church; one that celebrates diversity and embraces inclusiveness; one that focuses less on maintaining church buildings and structures, and more on building and maintaining church communities. My vision is that we would strive more fully to meet people where they’re at, and to journey more intentionally with them to where they are heading, learning to communicate the faith to them in ways that help them to make sense of their lives and encouraging among them the development of a practical and creative sense of their own nature as spiritual beings. My vision of the Church is that we would focus less on seeking to define right human belief, and more on seeking to defend a believer’s human rights. The Covenant that we need to breath new life into, and to embrace more fully, is the one we make in Baptism: to continue in the Apostle’s teaching and fellowship; to persevere in resisting evil; to proclaim by word and example the good news of God in Christ; to seek and serve Christ in all persons; and to strive for justice and peace among all people, respecting the dignity of every human being.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, July 28th, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I am a military chaplain who has spent the last 20 years serving in this interfaith ministry. I have been lucky enough because of my postings to have served the church in a number of Canadian dioceses, in Europe and on operational postings around the world. I have come to value many things about the Anglican Church that I had previously taken for granted and I have come to the realization that some of the things that I once thought important or necessary are really trappings.  When I have been in a position that has allowed it, I have worked hard to maintain my Anglican identity by helping at the local parish.</p>
<p>This summer I am again in the midst of a posting and moving away from a local congregation where I have been associated as an honorary priest for the past 3 years. In my final sermon in that place I used the Vision 2019 concept as the starting point for my sermon. In that sermon I suggested that there were 3 areas where I would like to see my church place some or greater emphasis in the next decade. All 3 of these are ministries mandated in the New Testament and at the core of Jesus ministry among us.</p>
<p>The first is the ministry of building relationships. Human beings are social creatures and in our increasingly technological world there are fewer and fewer human contacts. The extended family has been replaced with the extended friend list on Facebook. Your friendly neighbourhood bank teller has been replaced by a cash machine and online banking. Your checkout clerk at the supermarket has been replaced by an automatic checkout counter. You all know what is happening. Our small communities are disappearing. Our homes are being increasingly configured in such a way that the front porch has disappeared replaced by the privacy of the back deck. In this environment the church has the opportunity to be the place where everybody knows your name. We need to put a great deal more energy into building communities inside the walls of our churches. People who are longing for the contact of neighbours and an extended family need to be able to find it in the church.</p>
<p>The second ministry that we need to offer is the gift of hospitality. I have entered far too many Anglican churches in this country where people have been cold and aloof. We need to find ways to evangelize, to tell people who we are and what we have to offer. Just as importantly, we need to welcome people into the church as if they have come into our home. We need people to leave our worshipping communities for the first time feeling as if they couldn’t have gone to a better place. We have to get better at this and our motivation needs to be this: <em>Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for in so doing some have entertained angels without knowing it. Hebrews 13:2.</em></p>
<p>And the final ministry that I would give greater emphasis is the ministry of healing. Most of us come to church looking for a message of hope and acceptance. We know that we have fallen short and we also joyfully know that God forgives and accepts us. God also empowers us with the ministry of healing and reconciliation. We need to place a greater emphasis on the restorative nature of God so that we can be an empowered and restored people. The oil of unction is our sacramental symbol of this. I am convinced that this oil should be resourced as commonly as bread and wine and water from our sacramental tool chest.</p>
<p>This is the direction I would like to see the church take in the next decade. There is nothing particularly radical or new. Rather, I see it as the recovery of some of the things that will make us more like the New Testament church and provide a real contrast between the ways of the world and THE WAY.</p>
