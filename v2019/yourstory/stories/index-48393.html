	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>What would it look like,this partnership with other faiths? Worship, say. 

Could we worship with Muslims? They think Jesus is a prophet, but not God&#039;s Son. They think he wasn&#039;t crucified on the cross. 

For Anglicans who are Christians, we see Jesus as Saviour of our souls, having offered to God a full, perfect and sufficient sacrifice, one that demonstrates God&#039;s grace to sinners. 

These beliefs are incompatible. Christians and Muslims do not worship the same diety. 

I don&#039;t get what you&#039;re saying - it certainly doesn&#039;t make sense. If you&#039;re thinking of sharing worship with other Christians of a different denomination, then I&#039;m all for it. God&#039;s Kingdom transcends denominational lines when Jesus is at the centre of our interest. That&#039;s why so many Christian radio stations are successful. The speakers preach the Scriptures, not church life. The songs magnify Jesus Christ, and CHristians can wholeheartedly worship him without constraints of denominational focus.</description>
