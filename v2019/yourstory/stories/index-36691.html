	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Hi Lorraine,
I don&#039;t think the Anglican Church of Canada is going to collapse.  There are many great Christ-centered churches that do embrace the Truth of the Gospel, and I&#039;ve never heard a priest tell me the resurrection did not happen.  I&#039;m quite sorry that you&#039;ve had experiences such as you&#039;ve described.
I would like to know if you&#039;ve found another church to worship in, which feeds and nourishes you in your faith journey.</description>
