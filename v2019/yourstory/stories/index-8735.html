	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>As Christians we are called to have faith in our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.  We are not called to hold our faith in the church if the church deliberately operates contrary to the Word.  That is happening at this time with no obvious criticism or action from the Primate or the House of Bishops.  As a Christian Church we must be subject to the authority of Scripture and when we fail to do so we are no longer a Christian Church.  To be an Anglican one must first be a follower of Jesus Christ and a believer in the authority of His word – not a follower of so-called “political correctness” or by the false interpretation of inclusiveness and/or tolerance.</description>

		<description>I will come.
If/when same-sex marriage is allowed in the Anglican Church, I will come.
I hold out faith in our church.
If the buildings all fall down, if there&#039;s no money, if there&#039;s no meetings, no breakfasts, no men&#039;s clubs, I&#039;ll still be here, and I&#039;m not the only one.</description>
