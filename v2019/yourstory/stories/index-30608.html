					<p>To further express my opinions, until the church finds a way to stop using the common cup, our sensible informed educated youth will have some difficulty with this archaic practise. They are being taught in school and at home to be careful about drinking after others and to watch when drinking from fountains. What is being practised in our age is not only unsanitary but something strange to see. I listen carefully to our youth although I am a senior citizen and I think the <span style="line-height: normal;">liturgy<span style="line-height: 19px;"> should also be changed for the alter. Perhaps instead of using words e.g. drinking blood and eating flesh words could be changed to more beautiful and profound thoughts such as &#8220;<em>let us drink the wine with Him today and eat bread with</em> <em>Him who has made our lives complete</em>&#8220;. What beautiful changes we could make to our church if we would only follow our youth instead of being caught up with our own selfish ideas.</span></span></p>

				<small>Sent to us on September 29th, 2009</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I wrote this piece in celebration of the Diocese of British Columbia&#8217;s 150th anniversary.  I&#8217;m an active member of Christ Church Cathedral, Victoria.  The essay below is my own, and I solely take responsibility for its contents.</p>
<p>In Christ,</p>
<p>Justin</p>
<p>The Diocese of British Columbia will be celebrating its 150 year anniversary this weekend. These days I&#8217;m spending some of my time pondering the future of the Anglican Church. Skeptics from both the left and the right paint a dismal picture of the future for Anglicanism in Canada.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when every Anglican parish would have full attendance. The Church is experiencing in many ways the death of Christendom in North America and Europe. It used to be that people were expected to attend church every Sunday morning. Churchgoing was part and parcel of one&#8217;s own civic identity. For good or ill, Anglicanism has sometimes been historically characterized as a civic faith, in which its theology was strongly tied to British nationalism. We see its vestiges in the 1962 Book of Common Prayer, with its prayers for the monarch, the military, and Parliament.</p>
<p>And yet, 1962 could be seen as the last year of that stage of Anglican expression. The 1960s with the Vietnam War, the Sexual Revolution, and the Civil Rights Movement brought in an intense questioning of authority. The Church which have often seen itself as a paramount authority of morals and religion found herself criticized, often harshly, for being repressive, anti-democratic, and old-fashioned. People stopped automatically assuming &#8220;Father knows best&#8221; and started to assume that Father really didn&#8217;t have a clue. The wave of anti-colonialism brought into question the Church&#8217;s involvement with European imperialism. Feminism and gay liberation profoundly took issue with the Church&#8217;s sexual teachings. The increase in multiculturalism challenged the Church&#8217;s English identity, while the increased multiplicity of faiths called to question the notion that the Church was the only way to salvation.</p>
<p>Some Canadian Anglicans despair of the future. They look to Europe and see dismal signs, roughly only 10% of the population of France regularly attend church, and while the UK&#8217;s numbers are higher, most would predict that the future is grim for the Church of England. Churches despair of becoming simply shops in which people only think about faith when it comes time to get married, baptize their children, or organize a funeral. While spirituality may still be alive, organized religion is weakening.</p>
<p>But perhaps the problem is not:</p>
<p>1) Younger generations are lazy and immoral and refuse to go to Church</p>
<p>2) Secular liberals are winning the war against faithful believers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem is with us and our vision of what a faithful church should look like. I think we should stop thinking that every parish will be full and that every single person in our country will become a regular church-going Christian. In the short future, yes, some churches will close and congregations will disappear.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think that our job is to have full churches. Our vocation is to proclaim Jesus Christ in word and in our lives, and to minister with and to people. Perhaps we should stop trying to evangelize by figuring out the next silver bullet that would fill our churches, and start actually living the way of Christ. Because while the Church as an organized religion might be dying, the message of Christ is not and IMHO is needed in our culture just as much as the people who first heard his voice on the shores of Galilee.</p>
<p>My vision sees the Church as a prophetic witness, articulating in its worship, its outreach, and its daily expression the way of Jesus in contrast to our increasingly individualist society. Our duty is not to fill our pews with bums, but to intentionally live out the way of Jesus.</p>
<p>In a world in which people walk past homeless beggars with hardly a glance, where some of us seem to always find enough money to buy the latest IPOD, but never enough to give to charity, the Church truly should be the home for the poor. Here in our spiritual communities, the voiceless are given a voice, the poor are fed, and the downtrodden are given hope. The Church should be a home where every gay teenager who has been kicked out of his parent&#8217;s house finds affirmation, love, support and acceptance. The Church should be a home where poor and rich break bread, laugh, and cry together and in doing so, the walls that divide us slowly come falling down.</p>
<p>In a world where the instant response is violence, whether in the case of nations dropping bombs on the poor on the basis of &#8220;justice&#8221;, or whether in our offices and homes where we are quick to emotionally and psychologically snap at one another after being offended, the Church should be a place where peace is actively nurtured and reconciliation practiced daily through forgiveness, caring, and support.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should stop figuring out a quick solution to get more bums in our pews. Instead, perhaps we should instead focus on truly living out the way of Jesus. My hunch is that if we started doing that, then people would at the very least give us a shot. When they see us actively living in the Kingdom, they will indeed come and see what this Kingdom is all about.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday Diocese of BC. May you continue to grow in your walk with Jesus, learning step by step to follow Him on the path of justice, reconciliation and peace.</p>

					<p>What are my prayers and my dreams for the Anglican Church in 2019? I remember someone saying that when you ask people what their dreams are for their parish, diocese, national church and the Anglican Communion, the trick is not to tell them that they are really praying. Our dreams are our prayers.</p>
<p>First of all, I would see the Church being strong, loving and wise.  Strong enough to stand up for what it believes to be right. Loving enough to live together in spite of our differences and difficulties. Wise enough to steer a path that will carry us forward to 2019 and for years beyond.</p>
<p>Martin H. from Edmonton has provided us with a wonderful image in the parable of the snake.  While it continues to be a snake, it periodically renews itself by shedding its skin. It does not look back to what its skin used to be but forward to what it may become. While continuing to be the Church,  the Anglican Church of Canada, as a constituent member of the Anglican Communion continues to grow, to face old and new challenges, to continually reflect on what it means to be the people of God in God’s world.</p>
<p>May we recognize each other, walk together  in spite of differences in race, colour, doctrinal positions, gender, sexual orientation, financial status, seeing God’ s love reflected to all person in each other, One of my favourite quotes is from Archbishop Desmond Tutu: “there is nothing we can do that will make God love us less, there is nothing we can do that will make God love us more,”</p>
<p>My academic interest is the development of the Church and Christian doctrine and theology. St. Athanasius was exiled from Rome at least six times before his view of the Trinity was accepted as orthodox.  Wecannot expect to solved all the questions surrounding human sexuality and other isuues in twenty of thirty or forty years.  We need to walk together respecting both those who want change and those who do not.</p>
<p>I remember a prayer  that Bishop Timothy Matthew used to us, it is most applicable to the church today</p>
<p>May the Lord Jesus who walks with wounded feet</p>
<p>walk with you to the end of the road</p>
<p>May the Lord Jesus who serves with wounded hands, help you to serve one another.</p>
<p>May the Lord Jesus who loves with a wounded heart be your love.</p>
<p>Bless God where ever you go, and may you find the face of the Lord Jesus in the face of every one you meet.</p>
<p>May God bless us all.</p>
<p>Warren M.</p>

					<p>At present the Church seems to be stuck in a negative mode. It lacks vision and is distracted by contention over what are, in the grand scheme of things, peripheral issues &#8212; issues of minor theological and administrative difference and division which are generating more heat than light. As a result, its worship, religious education and prayer life are, at best, half-hearted and weak.</p>
<p>I want the Church to rediscover its real purpose as the Body of Christ on earth. I want it to overflow in worship of God. I want it to demonstrate love, hope and joy in all it does. I want it to regain its evangelical fervor so that it shares the Gospel message with the vast majority in our country who are ignorant of it in ways which bring many into relationship with God and the Church.</p>
<p>I see a need for us to be more biblically literate by all of us engaging in meaningful Bible study. Those who know their Bible and their faith are those who become the movers and shakers in the ministry of all God&#8217;s people to all God&#8217;s people both within and beyond the Church.</p>
<p>I see a need for us to be far more intentional and faithful in prayer, prayer which expects God to answer and to act.</p>
<p>My vision for the future is of a vibrant, worshipful, biblically literate, praying, loving and growing community of faith.</p>
<p>Patrick T.</p>

					<p>Where is your church now?</p>
<p>I am in the Anglican Church in Montreal, Quebec. It is a church very much in the minority in many ways. English is a minority, being Anglican is a minority in this Roman Catholic province, being faithful is a minority position in the most secular society in Canada. We have seen our Diocese go from 68,000 members in the 1970&#8242;s to 25,000 today, and it continues to shrink. At the same time we have seen our church and this Diocese recently get too caught up in same-sex issues and not concentrating enough on the overall mission we are called to. On my bad days, I am depressed. Yet I know in my heart that God has placed me here in this context, and I am meant to preach the word and be faithful to what God is calling me, and his people, to at this time in this place.</p>
<p>Where do you want the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019?”</p>
<p>I want to see the church reach out a lot more in mission both within and outside of Canada. I want to see the church listen carefully to the Holy Spirit and follow what God is calling us to. In our Diocese I want to see less emphasis on buildings and a lot more emphasis on mission. I want to see the church take up once again discipleship, to make strong disciples, not just church-goers. I want to see the church reach out to our secular society and tell the Good News, as well as what is working well in the church.</p>
<p>I thank the National church for this opportunity to vision.</p>

					<p>It is my hope that the Church will not be left behind, and indeed will not exclude itself from the mainstream of Canadian society, in terms of what has been, admittedly, a long and sometimes bitter debate over the expression of love and commitment between two persons of the same gender.</p>
<p>Thus, I really hope that the Anglican Church of Canada &#8212; my Church &#8212; will not only be allowing for same-gender blessings but perform actual marriages. And much earlier than 2019! That would be far too long!</p>
<p>Time to move on to other issues.</p>

					<p align="center"><strong>VISION 2019<br />
THE ANGLICAN PARISH OF CHRIST CHURCH<br />
GRANDE PRAIRIE, ALBERTA</strong></p>
<p>On September 13, 2009, worshippers at Christ Church, Grande Prairie, were treated to a PowerPoint presentation on “Paternalism in the Anglican Church”, which was summarized in one sentence:  “Paternalism in the Church is BAD.”  As part of our efforts to take ownership of our own Church, the worshippers then answered these questions:
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>In ten years, where would Jesus want this parish to be in terms of<br />
worship,<br />
education,<br />
prayer,<br />
evangelism,<br />
fellowship and<br />
loving service to others?</strong>

<p>While there were some time constraints imposed on the congregation by the context of Sunday morning worship, respondents were able to create the following lists. <a href="index-60263.html#more-484" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>
