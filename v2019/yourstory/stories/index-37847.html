	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Cathy and Brian, the Bible is not the Word of God, Jesus is. The Bible, as David said, is the record of human relationship with the Divine and, as such, it is a basis for our development in faith - but not the only basis. God has not stopped interacting with His creation since the Council of Carthage. God still speaks to us through 20th and 21st century prophets like Desmond Tutu and Sr. Joan Chichester, Henri Nouewen and Herbert O&#039;Driscoll. To be Christian does not mean &#039;believing all of scripture&#039;; it means living and growing in Christ, living the Great Commandment, and so much more. This grandmother agrees with every word that grandfather David wrote. His vision of the church is also my vision of the church.

		<description>If the Bible is imperfect and not The Word of God, then you undermine what it means to be Christian and you become something else. There are many religions out there who agree with some points in scripture, even major parts of it, but they do not call themselves Christian because to be Christian means to beleive all of scripture.</description>

		<description>Those who build their house upon the sands of a Bible that is not authoritatively known as the very Word of God will find their faith washed away when storms of life come along. 
Biblical literacy and belief in Scripture as the core document of our faith is a prerequisite to any life of any Christian community. The Primate ought to develop a program that enhances our understanding of Scripture. Mind you, having looked at a couple of his sermons, I find them lacking hermeneutical depth, since he seems to offer a &quot;state of the Church&quot; type talk rather than an exposition of Scripture. Still, our need is to understand that, how&#039;s it go? -- &quot;All Scripture is God breathed, and useful for teaching, correction, rebuke and training in righteousness...&quot;</description>
