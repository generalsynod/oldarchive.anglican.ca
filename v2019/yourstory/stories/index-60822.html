	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>So happy to hear that St. Mary Magdalene Anglican Church is flourishing.  I was married there in 1961 and have moved a few times in my life.  We currently live in Kanata but we spent 27 years in Stittsville.  We continue to worship at St. Thomas Anglican Church, Stittsville.  For several years now we have had a contemperary group which joins the regular church choir one Sunday a month and they also have one Sunday a month where they do the music.  It has been well received although in the beginning some of the people rebelled a bit.  I understand from some people in Napanee that you have had an Army Chaplain helping with the service.  Until yesterday we have had an Army Chaplain with us for two years.  He is leaving us for Halifax as he has been appointed as Lt. Commander of the Naval Chaplains.  We will miss him as he brought a new outlook to God&#039;s work in the Armed Service.
I wish you and your congregation well in all your endeavours. Happy anniversary and many more.</description>
