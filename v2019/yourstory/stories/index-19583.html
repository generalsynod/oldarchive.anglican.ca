	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>January 25 is memorialized in the Book of Common Prayer as &quot;The Conversion of st. Paul. He held to Judaism. At least six other days in the year honour missonaries, who by definition seek to have people change their faith to Christianity. The prayers at midday are all about inviting God to bring people of other faiths into a belief in Jesus Christ as Saviour. The BCP has a prayer [pg 41]  For the Conversion of the Jews.

O GOD, who didst choose Israel to be thine inheritance: Look, we beseech thee, upon thine ancient people; open their hearts that they may see and confess the Lord Jesus to be thy Son and their true Messiah, and, believing, they may have life through his Name. Take away all pride and prejudice in us that may hinder their understanding of the Gospel, and hasten the time when all Israel shall be saved; through the merits of the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</description>
