	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>What a wonderful community made this all possible! It must have been a very challenging time as you worked out the details of how this could all take place. How very rewarding to be able to enjoy the fruits of this labour in a great church family in your new home. Good Luck &amp; may others follow your lead.</description>
