	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Brian, it not what people think as to whether any situation is right or wrong.  What is crucial for ANY church that claims to be Christian is acknowledging and accepting:-
 a) the uniqueness of Christ and his sacrificial death and resurrection to free us from our sin.  There is salvation in no other.
 b) the authority and acceptance of the Scriptures and the Word of God - not any interpretation or diversion to make the church &quot;politically correct&quot;. 
 
Unless and until the Anglican Church of Canada is prepared to return to these two fundemental facts, it cannot claim to be part of the body of Christ.</description>

		<description>What kind of less division are you thinking of? Of course we all want less division. 
Some views are simply irreconcilable though. You cannot have a whole gang of happy people when some of them think that same sex blessings are a good thing while others think it is a bad thing.
I&#039;m surprised you didn&#039;t think that doing good works was a key point for the church, given that you&#039;re on the board of the Primates Relief and Development Fund. Instead you reference the Great Commission, [evangelism]. I do wonder at the point you make there, that Jesus wants us to make disciples who will become members of the Anglican Church of Canada. Have we not got grace to see new believers follow Jesus whereever he takes them, even if it&#039;s to another  church tradition. Salvation is unto Jesus, not the denominational structures that exist .</description>
