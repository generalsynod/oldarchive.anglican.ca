	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>The church must indeed welcome ALL sinners as each of us has a tendency to sin in one area or another.  This depends on our personality and our upbringing.  In stating this, however, the church cannot “bless” any sin regardless of any so-called political correctness.  We welcome sinners with the hope that they will be convicted by the Holy Spirit and brought to repentance.  The church cannot be the church of God if it deceives sinners into believing sin can be blest.</description>

		<description>I am in the process of earning my Doctor of Ministry degree.  As part of this process, I am writing about my journey which includes the hurts and pain that I have suffered from the Church during my Ministry.  I wish I could say that it was a warm and fuzzy experience.  But it has not been.  In fact, many people have asked me why I am still with the Church.  This is a question that I have found no answer to.  As we look at the church and the hope for it in the future, we must not leave out that the Church has caused many people a great deal of pain.  A lot of people have been hurt by the Church and then ignored.  I prayer is that the Church will be what Christ would want it to be: loving, compassionate, caring, supportive.  The Church needs to reunite itself with the mission and vision of the Christ our Lord.</description>
