					<p>I have hope that our Primate has the spiritual depth and the energy to implement the vital changes I am looking for.</p>
<p>I have worked as a consultant in Anglican Dioceses in several parts of the world. In only four of these dioceses have I noticed and been shown a special aliveness.</p>
<p>This special aliveness was only present when the Bishop in each of these four dioceses trusted and cared for his/her clergy &#8216;in the trenches&#8217;  of parish ministry as the A#1 priority. This commitment included the Bishop being vulnerable and risking in relationships with the clergy, and, not expecting clergy to trust their Bishop <em>a priori</em>. To be precise, it was the Bishop who took the first risk of being vulnerable, who offered trust to the clergy. Usually, it seems that the Bishop expects to be trusted and respected, but offers nothing personal to initiate the relationship.  Perhaps the present crisis of falling numbers, deficit financing, and</p>
<p>in some dioceses, pervasive anxiety among clergy, will bring out the best in some of today&#8217;s bishops.  The four bishops I alluded to above all had to pastor clergy who struggled with multi-point parishes, large geographic areas to serve, and, very very tight diocesan finances. The moral and trust was high. What a privilege to meet those four bishops!</p>
<p>The CEO-fund raiser-government-administrator bishop is not only an oxymoron but has, perhaps unwittingly, put power and position ahead of  the primary pastoral calling.  So many lay people are deprived of leadership in finance, management, program, and true responsibility because the bishop attends so many committees, chairs even more, and is a signatory on the diocesan cheque book. Admittedly, too many lay folk acquiesce to the style of a bishop who likes to be in charge.</p>
<p>My vision for 2019 includes a Church that will take the risk of calling men and women to the Episcopacy who are willing and able to trust and care for their parish clergy in action and in heart. A bishop who leads clergy with trust and care will be living Paul&#8217;s great description of Christ in Philippians 2 &#8211; the servant.  This goes hand in hand with trusting capable lay members to run the &#8216;business&#8217; of church &#8211; and leaving them to it. Yes this Vision will cause an upheaval: but what better time than now to transform the ethos of our Church when we are at a crisis point?</p>
<p>Blessings</p>
<p>David Rolfe<br />

					<p>Where is your Church now and Where do you want the Anglican church to be in 2019;</p>
<p>At the parish level, our Church is in a good place with new young families participating in the life of the Church, bringing with them energy and excitement.  We are trying to focus outward  instead of inward.  Both these realities indicate health.  Nationally, I think we are struggling to carry out our ministry in the face of too many internal struggles.</p>
<p>My prayer for the Anglican Church in 2019 would be that we are no longer spending our time and energy on these internal struggles but that we would recognize that we have a call to extend our energy for the healing of the world.  However, we cannot advocate for justice while maintaining unjust structures in our own Church.  In those areas where bureaucracy impedes ministry, I pray that we would change, dismantle, or streamline those structures so that we encourage and enable our clergy and lay people to minister to one another.  In a world where ‘church’ and ‘faith’ and the issues that occupy them are foreign to so many people, we need to exercise a servant ministry &#8211; one in which people will see us as a desirable place to be but one where there are not so many barriers that they are discouraged from being a part of us from the start.</p>
<p>It is more than time for us to recognize that God is calling us to take a leap of faith and accept gay and lesbian people as full members of our Church, with the right to receiving a blessing or with the right to be married in the Church if they desire, but also with the right to be ordained as deacon, priest or bishop.</p>
<p>If we allow ourselves to be held hostage by concerns that in the interim the number of people in our worshiping community may drop or our revenues may be down, then we are not being faithful to the gospel which tells us that faith is costly.  We have to be prepared for the fact that being faithful as we interpret it will not come without difficulty.</p>
<p>My hope is that when we say ‘mission’ or ‘Millennium Development Goals’, we will not be met with a look of bewilderment but instead will be met with understanding and with so many suggestions about what we should/could be doing to meet them that we won’t know which to tackle first, that every Anglican would know about the ministry we exercise through PWRDF and the integrity of the work that is accomplished through it, would understand just how privileged we are to be a part of that ministry and would open their hearts and wallets/purses accordingly.</p>

					<p>Kid Active Church Daycare &#8211; Saturday 3-5pm</p>
<p>Rebuilding an active Anglican Church in Canada requires reaching out to young parents.  In today’s fast paced world, both parents are working.  Rising before dawn, fighting with children to get them fed and dressed (ever tried organizing 3 kids before dawn ??), dragging them out the door with their coats half on, barely awake, struggling with traffic and increasing workloads. Exhausted from the ordeal of daycare from the age of 6 months old, both parents are working to pay the mortgage, property taxes, taxes and more taxes. Older children wait in the cold and dark for school buses to pick them up often before 7 a.m.  What sane reasonable working parents would enforce Sunday Church, particularly at the brutal hour of 9:30 a.m. on their stressed out lives?  Imposing any lack of weekend rest could precipitate deadly health issues, such as H1N1, on both parents and children.</p>
<p>Ministers should ask themselves ‘How can we help you?’, instead of ‘How you must help God by attending Sunday Church’, because there are obvious directions forward.  Dropping off young children for Kid-Active Bible School on Saturday afternoon, so parents can get the shopping done and the house cleaned, would be a big helping hand, while children enjoy learning to bake cookies, and setting up the Church Hall for Sunday, sharing Christian fellowship.  A small donation would cover the wages of a young college graduate recently qualified to provide child care, as well as a nation wide appeal to support Kid-Active Church Daycare.</p>
<p>What’s in it for the Church ??  Each building block is important, especially community foundations.  If the Church reaches out to assist young stressed families, then they may be surprised to discover improved attendance at community events organized by the Church such as pancake breakfasts, Kid-Active Baseball BBQ’s, winterlude skating and snowman contests, bowling and other social activities popular with young families.  Slowly Church attendance will improve as these families mature with the helping arm of a patient caring Church, learning to play together and pray together.</p>

					<p>I am so pleased that the national church has started the visioning process for Vision 2019.</p>
<p>The Diocese of New Westminster, of which I am a member, has, this summer past, ratified Plan 2018 at Synod and is beginning to implement some of the preliminary elements of the Plan.</p>
<p>Engaging in this exercise on a national level is necessary, courageous and long overdue.</p>
<p>I believe that many Anglicans in Canada are waiting for the church to deliver to them a prophetic call to action.  Some of us have waited for so long for this call that we have begun to think that the absence of such a call is the norm.</p>
<p>I applaud the decision to put to the church as a whole the questions, &#8216;where are we now and where do we want to be in 2019.&#8217;</p>
<p>At St. George, in Maple Ridge, we are doing the Lord&#8217;s work within our church community through worship, pastoral care, mutual support and education.  In our broader community we reach out to those in need locally, and, through the Diocese and the National Church, to those in need country and worldwide.  By and large what we do makes us feel pretty good.</p>
<p>I am not sure that it should.</p>
<p>In the work that we do I do not discern the Church speaking clearly and with urgency to our parish.  Nor do I see our parish speaking clearly and with urgency to our community.  What I see is people of goodwill and Christian inclination supporting, financially and morally, those who have been moved by the Spirit to act in our midst.</p>
<p>I am sure that we are all aware of this happening where ever we may gather in Christian community; a small group acts and the majority encourages.</p>
<p>If we want to spread the good news of Christ and to grow our denomination we must all lend our strengths to the tasks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll offer a small aphorism that I think captures our Anglican problem:</p>
<p>&#8220;others will not care<br />
how much we know (even if what we know is the key to eternal life)<br />
until they know<br />
how much we care&#8221;</p>
<p>If the church enhances in all of us the courage, the compassion and the skills to reach out to our neighbours, whether those neighbours be sitting alongside us or or sleeping rough, the Word will spread and the faith will grow.</p>
<p>That is what I would like to see Vision 2019 come to.  A call to direct action that rises up from this process, that is taken up by the ordained and then is passed back to the laity, not as a request but as a demand that we follow Christ as truly as we believe in Him.</p>
<p>Lead us.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I have been watching, reading and reflecting on most of the responses to this all important question, and have noticed many similar hopes for our future.  The desire for more youth, the hope for unity, and the greater acceptance of all people, are all tops on many lists.  There are others but it&#8217;s these social agendas which are so prevalent in many &#8216;visions&#8217;, that I wish to address.</p>
<p>As a church what is our mission?  Are we fighting to end the horrors of AIDS?  Are we trying to looking to erase atrocities happening to women in other countries?  Are we hoping to be inclusive of everyone and anyone&#8217;s behaviours as long as they are &#8216;good&#8217; people?  Or is it having lots of potlucks, fundraisers, soup kitchens, or saving the planet?  We in the Anglican Church of Canada have lost focus!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, all these missions are well intentioned and are worthy causes for any Christian&#8230;however, where is the Bible&#8230;where is Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>The social ills of society, the newest &#8217;cause&#8217;, or latest segregation, is always just around the corner; Jesus himself said, <strong>&#8220;The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.&#8221; </strong> And it&#8217;s not just the poor; all these other concerns will always be there also.  Until Jesus comes again, they will be with us.  Why??  Because we are sinful beings, human brokenness will continue to cause heartache and injustice somewhere.  With our focus increasingly on the poor (and other concerns), we are LOSING JESUS!!</p>
<p>The reality the Anglican Church of Canada is facing is that more of society is finding their spiritual needs met in these &#8216;good work&#8217; causes.  That means less and less are finding their spiritual needs met by Jesus Christ.  We are becoming merely a social club with a social agenda (or as I previously said multiple agendas).  And I hate to say it, there is already a multitude of organizations with social agendas doing the same thing; and the church is becoming simply one in a crowd.</p>
<p>What makes us unique is what we need to focus on.  Jesus Christ is what makes us unique!  But where is He?  Sure we remember Jesus in our Sunday worship services, but where is Jesus in our communities?  Heaven forbid we mention God or worse, Jesus, outside our church buildings&#8230;it&#8217;s not politically correct, we may offend somebody!</p>
<p>My vision for the future of the Anglican Church is one where we are not afraid to speak out about being a Christian, where we are not anxious about living out our faith.  My vision is being a church that understands and believes in Biblical truth, and one that teaches others everywhere that same truth.  My vision is being a church who knows it is by the death and resurrection of Jesus that we are saved, not by good works; it is only this knowledge of our salvation, which compels us to doing good works.</p>
<p>My vision is certainly NOT intended to say we forget the concerns of society, but instead to remember we need to address good works proudly in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour.  I believe if we do this, just like the early Christians who were willing to be persecuted for their faith, people will see <strong>what makes us unique is what makes us worth following!</strong></p>
<p>In short, any <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">club</span></strong> can feed and cloth the poor, but a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Christian church</span></strong> does the same in the name of Jesus Christ.  Is our future as a club or a church?</p>

					<p>We should dream big for the church in 2019.  Our parishes should be Bible-based churches.  We should commit ourselves to godly living; it is God who gives the growth.</p>
<p>Do we expect the church to grow?  Do we have enough biblical preaching, church pews, Sunday School teachers, prayer groups, youth group leaders, home Bible study leaders to encourage church growth in the next ten years?</p>
