	<description>Vision 2019 is a church-wide exercise to discern, dream, and decide where we think God wants the Anglican Church of Canada to be in 2019. Your voice is needed! The results will be shared at our next national meeting, General Synod 2010.</description>

		<description>Love your creativity for a special event like the road race. I remember running a road race on Good Friday, so I used a marker to write this text on the back of my shirt to witness to the other runners, &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; [Romans 5:8]</description>
