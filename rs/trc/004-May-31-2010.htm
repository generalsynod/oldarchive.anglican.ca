      <h2><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Headline" -->Residential Schools: Truth and Reconciliation Update #4 <!-- InstanceEndEditable --></h2>
      <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content" -->
      <p><strong>May 31, 2010</strong> </p>
      <p>The fourth of occasional updates on the work of the Anglican Church of Canada as it takes its part in healing and reconciliation between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals. These updates are written by Archdeacon Jim Boyles, consultant on residential schools.</p>
      <h3><strong>Winnipeg National Event, June 16-19, 2010</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>1. Truth and Reconciliation—it’s all about respect</strong></p>
<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s website for this event begins this way:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The<strong> Truth and Reconciliation Commission</strong> was created to talk about all of the experiences and impacts of the residential schools, and the path to respect and reconciliation.</p>
  <p>
    Come learn about the schools; come meet the survivors of those schools; come celebrate Aboriginal culture.</p>
  <p>
    Come to the first Truth and Reconciliation National Event, June 16 – 19 at the Forks in Winnipeg, Manitoba.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
        Visit the <a href="https://www.trc.ca">commission’s website</a> for more information about the commission, and follow the link to the page that highlights the event.&nbsp; Those planning to attend can register online.</p>
<p><strong>2. Anglican Participation at the First National Event</strong></p>
<p>An active and capable working group in the Diocese of Rupert’s Land is heading up local participation. Canon Murray Still and the Rev. Bob Webster were asked by the bishop, Don Phillips, to take on this task, and they are busy now coordinating volunteers to assist the commission and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs with local accommodation and transportation for survivors. They also are working to provide pastoral care volunteers at the site for survivors and their families. The group is charged with promoting the event within the diocese and region, and coordinating Anglican programming at the interfaith tent at the Forks during the four days. Murray, Bob, and their team have a strong commitment to the work, and are doing a great job.</p><p>
        From the national office, those who will attend the event are the Primate, Archbishop Fred Hiltz; the National Indigenous Anglican Bishop, Mark MacDonald; Director of Partnerships Henriette Thompson; Anglican Healing Fund Coordinator Esther Wesley; Assistant Archivist Laurel Parson; and <em>Anglican Journal</em> Staff Writer Tess Sison.</p><p>
        Anglicans from Rupert’s Land and the neighbouring dioceses of Brandon and Keewatin will also be present.</p><p>
  <strong>3. Academic Conference: Prairie Perspective on Residential Schools, Truth and Reconciliation</strong></p><p>
        This all-day conference will take place at the Forks on Thursday June 17 and is being organized by the University of Manitoba Centre for Human Rights Research Planning Initiative. Papers and panel discussions will explore two themes: “Truth, Memory and Reconciliation” and “Harms, Justice and Healing.” The concluding speaker in the evening will be Eduardo González, Director, Truth and Memory Program, International Centre for Transitional Justice, who will speak on “Lessons Learned From Past Truth Commissions.”</p><p>
        One of the panelists will be Terry Reilly, former archivist of General Synod.</p>
        <h3>
      <strong>Seeking Truth</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was mandated by the Settlement Agreement to develop a full and detailed record of the Indian Residential School system in Canada, in other words, seek truth. One part of this mandate involves collecting and analyzing historical records held by the churches and government, and this work is just beginning.</p><p>
        Another important aspect is to seek out and receive the stories of those involved in the schools—former students, their families, staff, the community and all other interested participants. To this end, statement-takers will be at the Winnipeg event so that survivors can tell their stories, either in private or publicly. The survivor will have control of the interview, which at his or her discretion may be audio- or videotaped. The use of this material will also be in the hands of the person relating the story.</p><p>
        The commission has plans to hire several statement-takers in each province where there were schools. They will travel to numerous communities to listen to personal accounts of experiences at the schools, either in community circles, or individually.</p><p>
        If a survivor wishes, a church representative may sit in on the interview. Several Anglican dioceses have selected and trained persons with good pastoral skills to attend these interviews (and also attend hearings under the Independent Assessment Process, when requested by the survivor). </p><p>
        TRC has also provided a Memory Book online where those who want to tell their story are encouraged to download and fill out the book and return it to the commission with a consent form. The book is available <a href="https://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/pdfs/Eng_Memory_book.pdf">online</a> It is also available in French and Inuktitut.</p>
        <h3>
      <strong>Truth and Reconciliation Commission Executive Director</strong></h3>
      <p>The commission’s executive director is Tom McMahon. Mr. McMahon is the former executive secretary of Manitoba’s Aboriginal Justice Inquiry. His Master of Laws degree thesis deals with the way the justice system treats Aboriginal Peoples. He is bilingual and was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1986. He has extensive experience as a Justice Canada lawyer with all aspects of administration of federal government institutions, statutes and policies, especially in relation to privacy, collaborative research, and records management.</p>
      <p><strong>General Synod 2010: Feeling the Winds of God—Charting a New Course</strong></p><p>
        Halifax and St. Mary’s University will be filled with Anglicans this week when about 500 gather for this triennial meeting of the church’s governing body. Twelve members of the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP) will be present as partners, along with other Aboriginal members of synod who have been elected by their diocese.</p><p>
        ACIP has a keen interest in resolutions that are coming forward to amend the church’s constitution and canons. Changes include</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To provide formally for the National Indigenous Anglican Bishop in the church structure.</p>
          <p>
            To add two members of ACIP to the Council of General Synod</p>
          <p>
            To add a new Canon XXII on The National Indigenous Ministry. The canon describes the role of the National Indigenous Anglican Bishop, ACIP, and the Sacred Circle. The latter is described this way: “The Sacred Circle performs many of the functions of a “Synod” for the Indigenous ministries:&nbsp; it provides an opportunity for representatives of the Indigenous communities to come together to worship, to discuss, and to communicate with the broader church.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        The origin of this canon is the covenant made by the participants at the 1994 Journey of Spiritual Renewal sponsored by ACIP:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “We acknowledge that God is calling us to a prayerful dialogue towards self-determination for us, the Indigenous Peoples, within the Anglican Communion in Canada.&nbsp; Through this new relationship we can better respond to the challenges facing us in a relevant and meaningful way.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        The resolution can be found <a href="https://www.anglican.ca/gs2010/resolutions/a051/">online</a>.</p><p>
  <strong>Primate’s World Relief and Development Fund (PWRDF)—Indigenous Development Program</strong></p><p>
        The Indigenous Peoples Development Program is built on core principles of trust, mutual respect and Indigenous participation in decision-making. The program follows the lead of 12 Indigenous partners to support project initiatives that build stronger, healthier and more self-reliant communities.</p>
      <p>Approximately $241,000 was provided within the PWRDF budget in the 2008-09 fiscal year for grants under this program. Here is one example of a funded project:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Kanien’kehaka Onkwawén:na Raotitiohkwa (KOR)<strong> </strong>is a cultural and language education centre located in the Kanien’kehaka (Mohawk) Territory of Kahnawake, near Montreal. KOR, established in 1978, provides workshops, presentations and seminars that focus on Mohawk language, history, culture, and traditions. The five-year partnership with PWRDF has enabled KOR to strengthen its language and cultural projects.</p>
      </blockquote>
<p>PWRDF will be concluding its 50th anniversary celebrations at General Synod in Halifax—the province that spurred its establishment in 1958 at the time of the Springhill mine disaster.</p>
