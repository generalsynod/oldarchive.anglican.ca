      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>August 19, 2010</strong>      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">This is the fifth of occasional updates  on the work of the Anglican Church of Canada as it takes its part in healing  and reconciliation between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals. As of August 2010,  these updates are written by Archdeacon Michael Pollesel, General Secretary of  the Anglican Church of Canada.      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>1. First public national TRC event a  success</strong></h3>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The first public Truth and  Reconciliation Commission (TRC) event was held at The Forks historical site in  Winnipeg, Man. from June 16 to 19. Most reports on this first of seven national  TRC events hail it as a great success. Thousands of Aboriginal and  non-Aboriginal participants gathered to reflect on residential schools  experiences through art, historical presentations, and statement-sharing, both  in private and in public. Organizers recorded 425 statements from former  residential school students. To catch up on coverage from the event, visit the <a href="https://www.trcnationalevents.ca/websites/trcevent2010/index.php?p=60">TRC  website</a> or read <a href="https://www.anglicanjournal.com/nc/news-items/article/a-writers-notebook-9240.html">reports  from the <em>Anglican Journal</em></a>.      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The next national event<strong> </strong>is scheduled to take place June 2011  in Inuvik, N.W.T. Because this is one of the areas where the Anglican Church of  Canada operated several schools, General Synod leadership has already begun to  think about how to best help the healing and reconciliation process at this  event.      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>2. Ongoing support for healing and right  relations</strong></h3>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Seven dioceses in the Anglican Church  of Canada have donated extra money to the Anglican Fund for Healing and  Reconciliation (AFHR) out of the refunds they received from the revised Indian  Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. Over $240,000 has been received from  the seven dioceses and, according to Esther Wesley, coordinator of the AFHR,  this money will be used &ldquo;not  just for healing but for projects that focus on &lsquo;right relations,&rsquo; which means  building relationships between Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals.&rdquo; <a href="https://news.anglican.ca/news/stories/2255?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+acc-news+%28Anglican+Church+of+Canada+News+Stories%29">Read the full story here</a>.      </p>
      <h3 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><strong>3. Archives essential behind the scenes</strong>      </h3>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">As the work  of the TRC continues, one of the unsung heroes behind the scenes is the General  Synod Archives.      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The  General Synod Archives acquires, preserves, and provides access to the records  of enduring value created by General Synod and its committees, councils, boards,  and commissions. It also holds the official papers of the Primate, the General  Secretary, and all other officers and employees of General Synod. The General  Synod Archives, which also house the Diocese of the Arctic Archives, cooperate  with the network of diocesan and provincial Anglican Archives to consider  common concerns, archival standards, and strategies.      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The General  Synod Archives hold many documents produced during the decades that the  Anglican Church of Canada operated residential schools. These include letters,  reports, newsletters, and other such written and pictorial documents that may  have made mention of various schools, students, and staff.      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">The General  Synod Archives will be an important source as the TRC gathers information about  residential schools. The Archives are committed to providing as much information  as possible, both to the TRC as well as to residential school survivors and  their families. In sharing this information, General Synod Archives always  adhere to laws governing individuals&rsquo; privacy.      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">For more information on any of these  items, contact Henriette Thompson, Director of Partnerships, General Synod, the  Anglican Church of Canada, 80 Hayden St. Toronto, Ont. M4Y 3G4, (416) 924-9199 ext.  213. </p>
