      <p>Chapleau’s first industrial boarding school for native children was established through the combined efforts of George Holmes, Third Bishop of Moosonee, and members of the local Ojibway Indian community. When Bishop Holmes moved the Diocesan headquarters south from Moose Factory Island to Chapleau in 1905, he converted his former residence to a boarding school (Bishop’s School). Chapleau was an important railway centre on the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway, which was completed 20 years earlier. On his arrival at Chapleau, Bishop Holmes saw the need for a similar boarding school and successfully appealed to the Church Missionary Society in England for funding. Local native groups also contributed money and offered their help in labour. <br />
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/P7538-714.jpg" alt="St. John's School" width="350" height="297" align="right" />Work commenced in August 1906 and the school building was opened in January 1907.  The residential school property comprised 153 acres, situated on the east side of Chapleau and fronting on the Nebskwashi River. Enrolment soon stretched the capacity of the school, ultimately forcing Church administrators to search for a larger, more suitable site to erect an entirely new building. <br />
        By 1920, a large tract of land had been acquired three km south of the town. It totalled 2,142 acres and straddled the CPR and the main road running south to Lake Huron (later King’s Highways 129 and 101). Here the large new St. John’s Indian Ressidential School was constructed in 1921. A small portion of the extensive school lands was cleared for cultivation but the remaining forested area was used as a source of wood fuel for the school until its closure in 1948.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Students were drawn from a large area within the Diocese of Moosonee, extending from Fort Albany on James Bay in the north, to the Fort Francis Reserve in Quebec in the east, to the Six Nations Reserve in the south, and to Nipigon on the CPR main line in the west. Most were Ojibway and Woodland Cree from the northern communities. In later years, and especially the period following the school’s closing, many children from the most distant of these native settlements were sent to other residential schools, newly built or enlarged, such as <a href="bishop-horden.htm">Moose Factory</a>, Fort George and <a href="shingwauk.htm">Shingwauk</a>.</p>
