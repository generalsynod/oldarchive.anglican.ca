      <p>The two Mackay Schools in Manitoba shared a common name and registration number with Ottawa, but in reality each was a unique school. They existed in different regions of Manitoba, under different Dioceses (Saskatchewan and Brandon), and in separate eras. The later Mackay-Dauphin School did not inherit a staff and student body from the original Mackay-The Pas School. The name honours Archdeacon John Alexander Mackay who had a long career in church missionary work in the Diocese of Saskatchewan in late Victorian times, culminating with his 1920 appointment as Superintendent of Indian Missions for the Diocese. Mackay died in 1923.<br />
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/P7538-443.jpg" alt="Mackay School" width="300" height="235" align="right" />In 1887, the Diocese of Saskatchewan planned to establish Indian boarding schools at Lac La Ronge and at The Pas. This was during a time of increased mission activity throughout the Diocese. While the Lac La Ronge All Saints School did become a reality in 1906, Indian Affairs felt there was no immediate need for a boarding school at The Pas (then situated within the Territorial District of Saskatchewan). The government was further petitioned in 1903 and 1907 by Indian leaders of The Pas Agency, who felt treaty obligations were not being adhered to and that education for their children should be conducted in a local residential school rather than at day schools. By this time, many of the region’s native children were being sent to the Elkhorn School, far to the south.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Following these representations and a strong case made by Archdeacon Mackay in 1910, Indian Affairs agreed to support a boarding school at The Pas. The capital cost was considerably reduced due to the recent arrival of the Canadian Northern Railway at The Pas, affording low cost shipment of construction materials. As well, the local Indian band at The Pas surrendered land to the Crown to be used for the school.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The Mackay Indian Boarding School officially opened October 1st, 1915 with a capacity enrolment of 81 pupils. The three-storey frame building was steam heated and lit by acetylene gas. A separate hospital was also erected nearby. The school was situated on Fisher Island, 10 km up the Saskatchewan River from The Pas. A good supply of water was always available but the land was unsuitable for farming except for a small vegetable garden. <br />
      </p>
      <p>In 1922, administration of the school passed from the Diocese of Saskatchewan to the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada (MSCC), who operated the school until fire destroyed the main building in 1933. A replacement building was not built here or elsewhere in Manitoba. Many displaced students were sent to Elkhorn and Lac La Ronge schools.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A generation passed before a new Mackay School was contemplated. Following the investigation of four possible Manitoba sites (including The Pas) in spring 1954, Dauphin was chosen the best location for a new residential school. An urban setting was preferred, for the availability of low-cost electricity, access to nearby public schools and logistics of transporting children to the school.  The former fair grounds in the town were purchased from the municipality and tenders soon prepared for construction. It would be built by the government and operated, once again, by the Church. Maximum enrolment was to be 250.<br />
      </p>
      <p>The Mackay Dauphin Residential School commenced operation September 1st, 1957 with 200 students in residence, most being of elementary school age. Additional dormitories were constructed in the 1960s to accommodate more high school students attending the schools in town. Conversely, many children from Dauphin attended Mackay’s junior classrooms. When the government assumed administration of the school in 1969, the building had become a hostel, with all residents taking classes in town.</p>
