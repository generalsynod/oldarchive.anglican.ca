    <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em>A sermon by</em></p>
    <p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;"><em>The Most Reverend Andrew S. Hutchison</em></p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0;"><em>Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada</em></p>
    <p>Since 1984, through the kindness of the Bishop and the Dean of Ottawa, the Primate has given a New Year&rsquo;s Day address in this cathedral on aspects of relations between Church and State.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the address is to keep church members informed of our dialogue with elected officials, and to remind those officials of the importance of issues raised in that dialogue. While it is acknowledged that many to whom these comments are addressed are not present, tomorrow the full address will be posted on our national website, and copies will be forwarded to ministers of the Crown along with a media release. What follows is a partial record of matters of concern shared by the Church and the Government over which we are in on-going conversation and/or collaboration.</p>
    <h2><u>A Word of Appreciation</u></h2>
    <p>My first word, however, is one of appreciation for all those who serve on our behalf both in the Government and in the Loyal Opposition, and for those who represent us in the diplomatic service. We recognize that you have accepted enormous responsibilities and daily contend with the hopes and expectations of Canadians and of the international community. With that comes a level of public criticism and personal scrutiny that few of us would welcome. It is because of that recognition that State prayers are a fixture in Anglican liturgy. Our common goal is wisdom, justice and peace in the conduct of our public life.</p>
    <h2><u>HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC </u></h2>
    <p>Again in 2006 HIV/AIDS remained the world&rsquo;s greatest on-going tragedy. Canada hosted the International Conference on AIDS in Toronto in August. The conference drew some 30,000 people from around the world in common cause. It is to Canada&rsquo;s credit that with two recent gifts to the Global Fund to combat AIDS&ndash; $230 million and $120 million respectively &ndash; we are a world leader in support of that fund on a per capita basis. It was not to our credit that the Prime Minister was absent from the conference, but surely enough has been said about that, and one hopes an important lesson has been learned. One of the Millennium Development Goals to which we are committed is to halt and begin to reverse the spread of AIDS. </p>
    <p>The Anglican Church&rsquo;s Primate&rsquo;s World Relief and Development Fund established in 2004 a Partnership for Life working with Governments and agencies on the ground around the world for a generation without AIDS. A financial goal of $1 million accompanied that program. I am pleased to report that already more than $2.3 million has been received and there is momentum to continue to grow this vital work. At the International Aids Conference the Anglican Church&nbsp; launched a powerful audio-visual display that is touring the country with its educational message, and will appear at our General Synod in June.</p>
    <p>There is, however, so much more to be done. Bill C-9 passed by the Canadian parliament has yet to deliver on its promise to make generic drugs available at affordable prices to those who need them most. And there is a need for leadership in an international effort to bring desperately needed medical practitioners to meet the crisis in Africa .</p>
    <h2><u>WORLD POVERTY</u></h2>
    <p>Inextricably bound to the AIDS crisis is the issue of world poverty. It is inconsistent with Canadian values that as a member of the G-8 we do not strive for leadership in giving 0.7% of GDP towards the elimination of extreme poverty. The commitment of our Church has surpassed that figure in every diocese in Canada, no matter how hard pressed. In March this year Anglicans from around the world will gather in South Africa for a global initiative on social justice, poverty and AIDS. The Anglican Church of Canada has taken as its theme for mission and ministry &ldquo;Serving God&rsquo;s World; Strengthening the Church&rdquo; and we are living into that theme in communities across Canada, and in the international community.</p>
    <h2><u>CANADIAN FORCES</u></h2>
    <p>Members of the Canadian Forces, after years of virtually exclusive peacekeeping missions, are once again deployed in active combat and experiencing casualties. With every deployment and on every base in Canada are chaplains. Among them are 40 regular force Anglican chaplains, and a similar number of reservists. Your Diocesan Bishop, the Rt. Rev'd Peter Coffin, has served since 2004 as a volunteer Bishop Ordinary to the Canadian Forces. While it is a disappointment to the Diocese of Ottawa that he takes early retirement as a diocesan bishop this year, he does so in order to devote more of his time to the support of our chaplains. I have established a fund for the support of that position, and welcome your participation in it. Our chaplains are among the unsung heroes of our Church and our society and they are deserving of your prayers and support as they in turn support our young men and women in uniform and their families. To them, and to Bishop Coffin, on behalf of a grateful Church, I say thank you.</p>
    <h2><u>CANADIAN MINING</u></h2>
    <p>As much as 60% of mining operations in the world are Canadian based. The Anglican Church is present in 164 countries, and has long standing partnerships with churches and agencies in the global south working in communities affected by Canadian extractive companies. We are aware that despite the best efforts of the Government of Canada to enjoin upon such companies voluntary compliance with generally accepted human rights and sustainable development standards, these efforts have been less than successful. We are aware of the implication of Canadian companies in such countries as Sudan, Ghana, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and the Philippines in toxic dumping, destruction of protected areas, forcible displacement of indigenous people, and threats and intimidation of local communities. We are grateful to the Government of Canada for sponsoring a series of roundtables on the subject, at one of which I presented our concerns. We urge the Government to follow through with legislation that will hold Canadian companies accountable in Canada when found complicit in human rights abuses and environmental destruction abroad.</p>
    <h2><u>INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS</u></h2>
    <p>2006 was a significant year in progress on the Indian Residential Schools file. The Anglican Church is particularly grateful to Mr. Justice Frank Iacobucci for bringing to realization a plan for the just resolution of outstanding complaints arising from residential schools. The proposal has cleared the courts, and compensation is being paid to elderly former students of the schools. The Anglican Church, acknowledging its own responsibility for the schools has raised over $18 million towards its obligation of $25 million and has paid out over $10 million in claims. It is hoped that early in the year under a Revised Agreement, our Church&rsquo;s obligation will be reduced to $17.3 million, thereby releasing funds for increased healing and reconciliation programs.</p>
    <p>Much remains to be done beyond the financial settlements, and the Church remains committed to its own program of healing and reconciliation. We continue to collaborate with the Government in the realization of a public Truth and Reconciliation program, including appropriate memorials of the legacy of the schools.</p>
    <p>We urge the Minister of Indian Affairs to implement the terms of the Kelowna Accord, which seems to have been set aside by the new government. The withdrawal of $160 million from the aboriginal cultural recovery and language programs is a matter of serious concern. The restoration of $40 million for language is welcome, but hardly an adequate replacement. That one in four indigenous children in Canada live in poverty is an offense to human dignity that must be addressed.</p>
    <p>John Ruskin has said, and it is difficult to disagree:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>&ldquo;I hold it for indisputable that the first duty of a State is to see that every child born therein shall be housed, clothed, fed and educated till it attain years of discretion.&rdquo;</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If it is true that it takes a whole village to raise a child, it is also true that it takes a whole nation to assure such benefits for our children, but Government and Church must take the lead.</p>
    <p>The National Housing Initiative, which expires in March, is one important move in the direction. We urge the Government to extend the National Housing Initiative for a further 3 years as other options for addressing the affordable housing crisis are considered.</p>
    <h2><u>HUMAN RIGHTS</u></h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights was drafted by Professor Humphrey at McGill University in l948. Canada demonstrated leadership in global human rights. Yet in</p>
    <p style="margin-top:0;">November 2006, at the United Nations Human Rights Council, Canada stood alone in opposing two human rights resolutions concerning the Syrian Golan and Israeli settlement in the Palestinian Territories. The cost to our national credibility was the rejection of 3 resolutions introduced to the Council by Canada.</p>
    <p>Canada also voted against the UN Declaration of Human Rights of Aboriginal People. Despite its opposition for whatever reason, we urge the Government to respect this important Declaration of the world community.</p>
    <p>In a land so blessed with natural resources, the need for wise stewardship of the environment should be self-evident. Yet it is clear that Canada lags behind in its commitment to the Kyoto Accord, and in its responsibility to the generations that follow us to reduce the toxicity of the environment. And it became clear in the recent elections that our leadership lags behind the clear will of Canadians in that regard. The Anglican Church continues to urge Government to give high priority to this global challenge.</p>
    <h2><u>DARFUR</u></h2>
    <p>A country the size of Canada, with limited military resources, must make difficult choices in the global deployment of those resources. In the Southern Sudan, however, we are witnesses to a virtual genocide. In light of recent United Nations affirmation of the obligation to protect, we should surely make every effort to promote serious international intervention, accompanied by massive humanitarian aid. We urge the Minister of External Affairs to give highest priority so that the tragedy of Rwanda is not repeated. </p>
    <h2><u>IMMIGRATION</u></h2>
    <p>Canada is clearly a destination of choice for global immigration. Reports come to us of increasing difficulties and costs for Visa applicants. We call on the Government to conduct an in-depth review not only of its policies, but also of the application of those policies in consulates and agencies off shore. We offer our full cooperation in providing information to any such review process.</p>
    <p>We question whether justice is done, and seen to be done, in cases of refugee applicants. A ruling by a single judge, who may or may not be legally trained, cannot be challenged as to the merits of the application. We urge the Government to implement a merit-based appeal, as approved by the Parliament nearly five years ago.</p>
    <p>Prime Minister Mackenzie King said in 1927:</p>
    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <p><em>&ldquo;A nation, like an individual, to find itself, must lose itself in service to others.&rdquo;</em></p>
      </blockquote>
    <p style="margin-top:0;">Much is said about Canada being a nation in search of itself. Its contribution to the defense of freedom in two world wars, its drafting of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and its leadership in establishing and serving in United Nations peace keeping operations around the globe are but a few examples of its finding an identity more readily recognized by others than ourselves in service to the world community. We are still a young country with an enormous potential. In the rotunda in the centre block of the parliament buildings are the words from the Judaeo-Christian Scriptures, <em>&ldquo;Where there is no vision the people perish&rdquo;.</em> Five hundred years ago Francis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England, referred to the four pillars of government as being &ldquo;religion, justice, counsel and treasure.&rdquo; It is in the on-going dialogue among the faith community, the courts, the government and the financial institutions that the vision is articulated. And for us, that vision is nothing less than God&rsquo;s reign of justice and peace.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">As Christians we celebrate the initiation of that Kingdom in the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a kingdom won not by might or by the sword, but by the Spirit of God quickened in human hearts, and recognized in deeds of self giving service and sacrifice that witness to the love of God for all creation. The start of a new year gives us an opportunity individually, as a community of faith, and as citizens of the world to awake to the Spirit stirring within us and among us, to call us to the fullness of our humanity. May the recognition of that opportunity be your blessing for the New Year, and may God grant us all the courage to act upon it.</p>
