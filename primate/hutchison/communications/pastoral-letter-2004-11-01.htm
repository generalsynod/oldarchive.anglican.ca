                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
    <p align="right">St Andrew's Day November 30, 2004 </p>
    <p>My sisters and brothers in Christ, </p>
    <p>The six-month anniversary of my installation as Primate is upon us and
      I want to begin my pastoral letter to you with a word of thanks. Since
      June, I have had many opportunities to be with Anglicans across our country.
      We have a Church that is full of faith, life and energy. From coast to
      coast to coast I have spoken with children and young people, clergy, lay
      people, government officials, aboriginal leaders and our ecumenical partners.
      What I have discovered are communities of faith and love that give hope
      through the gospel of our Lord. I thank you for your ministry and for the
      prayerful support that I have received. </p>
    <p>I write to you at this time at the request of the House of Bishops. We
      recently met in Saskatoon , with a spirit of reconciliation and fellowship
      marking our time together. The House passed a unanimous resolution receiving
      the Windsor Report with gratitude, recognizing its importance and commending
      it to the Church for study. A second resolution asked me to write a pastoral
      letter inviting the people of our Church to make submissions about the
      report. </p>
    <p>The Commission that produced this report was created by the Archbishop
      of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, at the request of the Primates and was chaired
      by Archbishop Robin Eames of Armagh , Ireland . The Commission comprised
      19 people from 14 of the 38 provinces of the Anglican Communion and who
      covered a broad spectrum of geography, culture and theology. The Rev. Canon
      Alyson Barnett-Cowan, the director of Faith, Worship and Ministry for the
      Anglican Church of Canada, was a member. It is extremely important to realize
      that this was not a committee to settle the difficult questions that we
      face about blessings of same sex relationships. Their mandate was to maximize
      unity within the worldwide Anglican family despite the differences that
      we may have. The recommendations they made were unanimous. </p>
    <p>The report begins by describing the relationship called communion, into
      which Christians are called by God, and how this relates to the mission
      of the Church. It then describes the current difficulties and tensions
      that the Anglican Communion is experiencing. </p>
    <p>The next section deals with principles of biblical authority and interpretation.
      How we hold these principles and make decisions, as close as possible to
      the local level, is one of the difficult questions that is raised. A clear
      challenge is the discernment of those issues that we can disagree about
      without dividing the Church. </p>
    <p>The report then moves to its recommendations on the future life of the
      worldwide Anglican Church. It describes Instruments of Unity, especially
      the ministry of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and recommends the creation
      of an Anglican Covenant that would define the relationships among the member
      Churches of the Anglican Communion. </p>
    <p>Further recommendations are directed to the Episcopal Church of the USA
      , and our own Canadian Diocese of New Westminster, asking them to express
      regret that their actions were undertaken without sufficient consultation
      with the rest of the Communion. It also called for a moratorium on the
      ordination of any further bishops who live in same gender unions and urged
      bishops not to approve Public Rites of Blessing for same sex relationships
      until &quot;some new consensus&quot; emerges internationally among Anglicans. </p>
    <p>Another recommendation calls on bishops who have intervened in other dioceses
      and provinces to express regret for &ldquo;the consequences of their actions&rdquo; and &ldquo;to
      effect a moratorium on any further interventions.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>On my most recent webcast, available through our national Church website
      ( <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/">www.anglican.ca </a>). I invited all
      members of our Church to share their thoughts on the Windsor Report with
      me. I continue to seek responses. I have also invited each diocese to make
      an official response. These initial responses will become part of the message
      I take to Belfast , Northern Ireland , when all the Primates of the Anglican
      Communion meet in February 2005 and again to the Anglican Consultative
      Council that will meet in Nottingham , England , in June 2005. </p>
    <p>Our General Synod has recognized the integrity and sanctity of committed,
      faithful same sex relationships. When we meet next in June 2007 we will
      need to address the outcome of these international consultations and our
      own Canadian processes to discern what decisions are appropriate for the
      life of this Church. </p>
    <p>When the Primates gathered in 2000 they stated that <em>&quot; </em>We
      are conscious that we all stand together at the foot of the Cross of Jesus
      Christ, so we know that to turn away from each other would be to turn away
      from the Cross.&quot; </p>
    <p>My love for Our Lord and our Church compels me to address these issues
      with determination, not for the purposes of winning or losing, but to honour
      the gospel values that we all share. I pray that you will accompany me. </p>
    <p>I close with the concluding words of Archbishop Robin Eames' foreword
      to the Windsor Report: </p>
    <p>&quot;The Lambeth Commission&hellip;offers this Report in the prayerful
      hope that it will encourage the enhanced levels of understanding which
      are essential for the future of the Anglican Communion. Above all I pray
      it will be viewed as a genuine contribution to what communion really means
      to Anglicans.&quot; </p>
    <p>I wish you a blessed Advent and a peaceful and joyful Christmas. </p>
    <p>Yours faithfully, </p>
