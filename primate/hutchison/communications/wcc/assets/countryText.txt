The assembly is the supreme legislative body of the WCC and meets every seven years.  The WCC has a rich history.  It was established in 1948, at the same time as the United Nations.  In fact, the United Nations building and the WCC offices are close to each other in New York.</p><p>
Speakers at the assembly in Porto Alegre included Archbishop Desmond Tutu (retired), who spoke about the profound impact the WCC had on apartheid in South Africa.</p><p>
The theme of this assembly was <i>God, in your grace, transform the world</i>.</p>

The stated goal of the WCC is to have 25 per cent youth representation on the central committee.
