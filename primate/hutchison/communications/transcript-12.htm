                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
    <p style="margin-top:0;">Welcome back to <em>Conversations with the Primate</em>. </p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s been several months since the last webcast and during those months, there&rsquo;s been a great deal of activity. I&rsquo;ve continued to make major diocesan visits across the country. And I&rsquo;ve been to Nottingham England, to the Anglican Consultative Council, I&rsquo;ve had a wonderful trip to the church in Armenia, I&rsquo;ve been to the Lutheran General Convention in Winnipeg, and to the American House of Bishops in Puerto Rico, and have been very much on the move. But what I&rsquo;d like to talk to you about today is a very special event that happened during August, namely, the Sacred Circle at Pinawa, Manitoba.</p>
    <p>Each diocese across Canada is asked to appoint representatives to the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples. And on five occasions now, that council has called together a national Sacred Circle. Each one of our more than 200 native congregations across the land are invited to send members to that.</p>
    <p>So in August, probably 150 of us assembled in Pinawa for the fifth Sacred Circle. To it, as well, were invited partners &ndash; overseas partners from New Zealand and from the United States and all of the Bishops of the Council of the North were invited as partners. This was my first experience of a Sacred Circle. It was a full week of being among indigenous Anglicans from all across the country, and I considered that a very privileged experience.</p>
    <p>I was particularly delighted that virtually every diocese represented also sent a youth member to the circle. Anglicans have had a very long walk with native Canadians and this has very much been their church for generations. Native Canadians, of course, include many different nations and many different languages. But of course, with a lot of commonalities.</p>
    <p>Some of those were reflected in our gathering; we had a sacred fire, and traditional drumming and traditional songs from native spirituality that many of our Anglican indigenous people see as entirely consistent with the Christian faith.&nbsp; We began our gathering in Eucharist &ndash; that is in Thanksgiving for the good news of God and Jesus Christ and all that He has been doing in our midst.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m told that previous Sacred Circles had been very heavy with grieving and anger over the very unfortunate aspects of the residential school legacy. I&rsquo;m happy to say that this Sacred Circle had quite a different tone. And those who had been at other such circles certainly echoed that feeling. That&rsquo;s not to say that there isn&rsquo;t still some grieving to be done, that&rsquo;s not to say that there isn&rsquo;t still some anger, but there really is some progress and some determination to move ahead as indigenous Anglicans.</p>
    <p>We heard a wonderful presentation from Dr. Martin Brokenleg, of the Vancouver School of Theology, on <em>Reclaiming our</em> <em>Youth</em>. What do we do as parents, either in native communities or in non-native communities? What do we do as parents to give our children confidence and self-esteem as they grow and mature? It was a magnificent presentation that left many of us wishing that we could raise our children all over again.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>I think at the core of the meeting, the most important issue was a draft document that was brought before 41 elders of the community that proposed to the Primate and to the Church that within a year, a national indigenous bishop for the Anglican Church of Canada be appointed. The bishops present at the meeting were meeting in their own circles from time to time and reflected carefully on this. The elders reflected carefully on the draft document and eventually came to unanimous approval of it. The document was then put to the full Sacred Circle and each and every member of the circle stood and voted in favor of the proposal.</p>
    <p>The elders then placed that proposal formally in the hands of the youth delegates to the circle. And it was the youth, who represent the hope and the future of indigenous Anglicans, who presented the petition to me, as the Primate. With me stood all the other bishops present. And in receiving the document, I was able to say that I speak for all the bishops present in saying that we support, fully, the proposal for the appointment of a national indigenous bishop for the Anglican Church of Canada, within the next year.</p>
    <p>That announcement was received with delight and excitement and enthusiasm certainly gave the entire gathering a quite different tone from anything there had been in the past. All of this is in response to the Indigenous Covenant that seeks self-determination for indigenous Anglicans within the Anglican Church of Canada. Just how to interpret that has been the challenge of the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples. Across the country, as I&rsquo;ve met with indigenous Anglicans, there are various movements to find expression to that kind of self-determination within the Anglican Church.</p>
    <p>And the hope of the Anglican Council of Indigenous People and of that Sacred Circle is that the establishment of a national indigenous bishop will be a step in the right direction. I made it very clear that this first step would be for a pastoral bishop, not a bishop with jurisdiction in the sense of a diocese, but that he would be a pastoral support to bishops across the land in the ministry to indigenous people within their diocese, and that he would be a voice of advocacy for indigenous peoples across the country and a strong representation with the House of Bishops.</p>
    <p>I also made it clear that it&rsquo;s very important that if this is a step in the direction of self-determination, that such a bishop must be supported not by the non-indigenous church, but it must be supported by indigenous Anglicans across Canada. There are, of course, many issues still to be resolved by the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples, in consultation with the House of Bishops, in consultation with the Primate and with the Council of General Synod, the Council of the North is also a part of the conversation. </p>
    <p>But this is a very important step that has been taken by you, the indigenous members of our church and I have nothing but appreciation and congratulations for having taken this bold initiative, which I am convinced is a helpful step as we continue to walk together in our journey in Christ.</p>
    <p>I invite all of you to give your own responses to this historic proposal.&nbsp; The email address is before you, please be in touch with me and I&rsquo;ll look forward to meeting you again in the next <em>Conversation with the Primate</em>.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:0;">God bless you.</p>
