                  <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="BODY" -->
    <p><strong> Andrew Hutchison <br />
    </strong><strong>Archbishop and Primate </strong></p>
    <p> My principal secretary&rsquo;s wife teaches Grade One in an independent boys' school in Toronto. A few weeks ago, during one of their activities, the boys were asked to find the names of eight places in Canada, using a map, globe or atlas. Two boys, lying quite comfortably on their stomachs on the carpet, jumped up with glee and announced that they had found where God lives! When the teacher asked them to explain their exciting news, she was proudly shown an atlas: &quot;Look here!&quot; said the first little boy. &quot;He lives in God's Lake. He lives in Manitoba!&quot; </p>
    <p> Now, it should be mentioned that the teacher had recently introduced the possessive form, using an apostrophe before the letter &quot;S&quot; to the class. The second little boy proudly announced, &quot;And we know he lives there because it is apostrophe S.&rdquo; A third little boy, who was working independently, called out from another part of the classroom, &quot;That must be where Jesus learned to swim so well!&quot; </p>
    <p> Children have a way of making Christmas very meaningful. Excitement, joy and laughter are contagious as we see their faces and listen to their hopes and dreams about what Santa will place under the tree. Children also have a way of speaking the truth when we as adults too often complicate our lives with self determined &quot;matters of consequence.&quot; I agree with my young friend that God lives in God&rsquo;s Lake, Manitoba, although I suspect that he learned how to walk on the water rather than swim. </p>
    <p> The great truth about Christmas is that God comes and lives within us. The meaning of Christmas is seen in Matthew 1:23 where the evangelist tells us that the word Emmanuel means &ldquo;God is with us.&rdquo; </p>
    <p> How easy it is to lose sight of that in the midst of the rush and pressure of the season. Sometimes we think that by piling up events and duties we will create meaning -- that because we are busy we are doing something significant. This is simply not true. </p>
    <p> Just as children have the ability to help us discover the true meaning of this blessed season, so do Christmas carols. Each year, as I sing their familiar refrains, I find that the rich meaning of those words refreshes my heart and soul. One that stands out for me is, <em>O little town of Bethlehem</em>, by Philip Brooks, a former Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts. Canon Frank Colquhoun in his book <em>A Hymn Companion</em> writes: </p>
    <p><em> &ldquo;Against the background of the sleeping town of Bethlehem the hymn gives poetic expression to the story of the first Christmas night and the wonder of God&rsquo;s entry into human life in the child born to Mary. It also has something to say about what this should mean to us: for as it begins with Christ born in Bethlehem, it ends with Christ born in the heart.&quot;</em></p>
    <p> May this Christmas be a time of great joy and peace for you and may you discover that Christ is born and lives not only in Manitoba but also within you. </p>
