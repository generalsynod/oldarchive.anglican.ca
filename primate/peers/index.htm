</tr></tbody></table>
  His return to the Church while at university was a significant turning point in his life: &quot;I went back to church for the simple reason that a friend of mine invited me,&quot; he notes, &quot;and that's how most people become involved in church.&quot; In his case, the involvement led to divinity studies at Trinity College (Toronto) from which he graduated with a Licentiate in Theology in1959.
  <p>Prior to attending Trinity College, Archbishop Peers received an interpreter's certificate for German-English translation from the University of Heidelberg (1955) and a Bachelor of Arts (honours) in Slavic Studies from the University of British Columbia (1956). He hasreceived numerous honorary degrees over the years, including a doctorate in 1988 from the University of Kent (Canterbury).</p>
  <p>Michael Peers was ordained as a priest in the Diocese of Ottawa in 1960. He has served the Anglican Church as university chaplain (Ottawa,1961-1966), parish priest (Winnipeg, 1966-1974), Dean of Qu'Appelle (Regina, 1974-1977), Bishop of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle (1977-1986),and Metropolitan of the Province of Rupert's Land (1982-1986). He was elected to the office of Primate by the 31st General Synod held in Winnipeg in 1986.</p>
  <p>As Primate, Archbishop Peers brought a special concern to encourage greater inclusiveness in the life of the church and to address major issues facing Canada and the world from a Christian perspective.</p>
  <p>By virtue of his position, Michael Peers was also President of the Metropolitan Council of Cuba, providing a personal link between the Cuban Episcopal Church and the rest of the Anglican Communion.</p>
  <p>Archbishop Peers is fluent in French, German and Russian as well as English. At the 1988 Lambeth Conference at Canterbury he convened a historic first meeting of French-speaking Bishops and was the first to preside over meetings of the Lambeth Conference in a language other than English. Archbishop Peers is known as astrong supporter of ecumenism and during the 1990s served on the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches.</p>
  <p>Michael Peers is married to Dorothy Elizabeth (Bradley); they have three grown children and two grandchildren.</p>
