<EM>Subject: Online Viewing of General Synod</EM>
<BR> 
Thank you for your hard work re the above.
<BR> 
Appreciated the Prolocutor's greeting last night to online visitors.
<BR> 
One suggestion:  might it be possible to briefly advise those of us
tuning in as to what we are watching?  He mentioned that the discussions
of the afternoon were continuing.  It became evident that the future of
the National Church, especially relating to First Nations' peoples'
experience, was the topic, however...
<BR> 
Also, if possible, if voting on the resolutions is imminent, e.g., in an
hour's time (approximate), might this also be mentioned at the beginning
of the broadcast?

	Thank you for the webcast, I am only sorry that I didn't know about it before today.

	I have been connected to the webcast as much as possible  since the
	beginning of General Synod. It has been wonderful to be able to participate
	in this manner. <BR>
        I will not be able to connect to many more sessions as I am headed to the
	TAIP (Train an Indigenous Priest) School for the next few days. Every
	Blessing! Sure wish I was there!

The Synod Live Broadcast is great.  Thanks!  It was amazing to see live, our son do the reading
from Revelation at Night Prayer tonight.

I rushed home from church and caught the last 2 verses of the final hymn
and AB Peers blessing. (I hope it works via the www!)
<BR>
Since it took place at the synod site -please run it again. Thank you.
<BR> 
The coverage has been excellent and exciting- and humbling.
<BR> 
Imagine to a kid that TV was a miracle -- can now "tune in " on the
computer -- and really be there . Thank you for the interaction. AND I
didn't have to drive 600 miles to do it!

Congrats to all on excellent
reporting from the GS2001 website. I hope our Diocese (Quebec)
can do something similar but on a smaller scale when we meet at our
Synod in September.
<br> 
Wish I had been there in person at such a historic synod, but I at least
kept you in prayers and followed the web-based reporting throughout.
<br> 
Quite an innovation, this web reporting.
