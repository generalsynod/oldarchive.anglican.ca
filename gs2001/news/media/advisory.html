<H2>MEDIA ADVISORY</H2>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>NATIONAL
BODY OF ANGLICAN CHURCH OF CANADA PREPARES FOR 36<SUP>th</SUP>
MEETING OF GENERAL SYNOD IN MOOD OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM</B></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Toronto, 13 June 2001</B>
- Senior leaders and lay delegates representing more than 2,200
congregations of the Anglican Church throughout Canada will meet for
8 days next month to discuss a range of crucial issues facing the
country's third-largest religious denomination as Anglicans convene
for the 36<SUP>th</SUP> Meeting of General Synod, to be held from
July 4 - 11 at Waterloo, Ontario.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>With 2.3 million members
nationwide, according to the last Canadian Census, the Anglican
Church serves as a major force in social assistance in communities
across the country, injecting several million dollars every year -
supported by hundreds of volunteers and other care workers - into
community, social service and pastoral programs.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Against this backdrop,
next month's meeting of General Synod - the name given to the
church's highest decision-making body, which convenes its national
meeting every three years - will force Anglican members to grapple
with a range of challenging issues affecting its future as a
spiritual, pastoral and community-based institution. Among issues to
be reviewed at the weeklong Synod conference are the following: 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Residential
	Schools Litigation</B>: General Synod will review the impact - and
	potential outcome - of extensive litigation against four Christian
	denominations (including Anglicans) for their involvement in
	administering Residential Schools for Aboriginal Canadians from the
	early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century until 1969 as agents of the federal
	Government of Canada. With legal and administrative fees against
	Anglicans totaling nearly $5 million over the past two years, the
	Anglican Church has stated repeatedly that failure to achieve a just
	and workable settlement with the federal government by yearend will
	exhaust the assets of the church's national office and risk the
	collapse of nine regional dioceses named in hundreds of lawsuits by
	individual plaintiffs and through 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party actions
	brought against the church by the federal government.</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>General Synod will
		hear reports updating the status of lawsuits as well as progress in
		discussions underway with the federal government through the Office
		of the Deputy Prime Minister and the newly formed Office of Indian
		Residential Schools Resolution of Canada.</P>
		<LI><P>In three sessions
		entitled &quot;Planning for the Future&quot;, Synod will evaluate
		best-case options for sustaining vital functions of the Church in
		response to worst-case scenarios brought about by continuous,
		unrestrained financial hemorrhaging. 
		</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P><BR></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Ecumenical Union
	with Canadian Lutheran Church</B>: After many years of intensive
	study, the Anglican Church of Canada will celebrate an historic
	entente with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC). The
	two denominations - both holding simultaneous meetings in the same
	southwestern Ontario city - are expected to ratify &quot;<I>The
	Waterloo Declaration</I>&quot;, granting mutual recognition and full
	communion rights. The declaration will bring Anglicans and Lutherans
	in Canada into line with similar ecumenical understandings between
	the two denominations - both forged during 16<SUP>th</SUP> century
	Reformation in Europe - already established in the United Kingdom,
	northern Europe and the United States.</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Aboriginal Healing
	and Reconciliation Programs</B>: The commitment by the Anglican
	Church to maintain a constructive, ongoing presence in Aboriginal
	communities throughout the country is evidenced by a wide array of
	programs, funded by Anglican contributions totaling $7 million. The
	widespread - and strengthening - Anglican ties with indigenous
	Canadians is further evidenced by the presence of four Aboriginals
	among the Anglican House of Bishops and over 225 Anglican
	congregations in Aboriginal communities. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Gay-Lesbian
	Relations</B>: General Synod will assess opportunities to forge
	greater consensus among progressive and conservative elements in
	furthering the Church's efforts to welcome gays and lesbians into
	mainstream church life, an initiative passed at the 34<SUP>th</SUP>
	Anglican General Synod in 1995. While no formal ruling is expected,
	Waterloo Synod may also review a resolution endorsing same-sex
	marriages passed by a slim margin earlier this month by the Diocese
	of New Westminster in Vancouver.</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Human Rights /
	Christian Ethics in Global Affairs</B>: Synod delegates will
	evaluate the appropriate stance of ethically-mindful citizens on a
	range of issues of geo-political significance - ranging from
	shareholder divestment in Talisman Energy Inc., operating in Sudan,
	to protection of migrant workers' rights and condemnation of alleged
	human rights abuses in countries such as Indonesia and Burma.</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Overall theme of the 36<SUP>th</SUP>
General Synod is &quot;<I>Towards Healing, Reconciliation and The New
Life</I>.&quot; Other highlights of the church's first meeting in the
new millennium are as follows:</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Opening Address by
	Bishop Steve Charleston, formerly Bishop of Alaska, currently Dean
	of the Episcopal Divinity School in Boston and a leader among
	indigenous church communities in Canada and the U.S.;</P>
	<LI><P>Discussion and
	passage of a new blueprint for partnerships between indigenous and
	non-indigenous Anglicans - entitled &quot;<I>A New Agape</I>&quot;;</P>
	<LI><P>Celebration of the
	first joint service of worship between the Anglican and Lutheran
	Churches following passage of <I>The Waterloo Declaration</I>.</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Throughout the duration of
the eight-day event, proceedings of General Synod will be broadcast
through live webcast on the Synod website
(http//:www.anglican.ca/synod). In addition, the Anglican and
Lutheran Church conferences will be connected throughout the
proceedings by direct website links.
