<p><b>5. Healing Service</b>
</p>

Text of the acceptance of the Primate's apology by The Right Rev. Gordon Beardy, Bishop of Keewatin:
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before I say the dismissal, I would like to say to the Primate, not as a bishop of the Anglican Church, but as an Anishnawbe who went to a residential school: from my heart, I would like to say that I forgive you and I want to forgive your church which has become my church.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I forgive your people who have become my people.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I accept your apology because you have worked so hard to break down the barriers. Where things that were condemned before, today you receive them with joy. Where once we were outsiders, today we are with you, as a friend, as a leader, as a brother. So, I extend my hand.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

My children will hear what I said. My grandchildren will hear. For it is in forgiving that we can find peace and it is in rebuilding that we will become strong again as nations.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Lord be with you. Let us depart in peace.

<p><b>Tuesday, July 10, 2001</b>
</p>

<p><b>1. Motion</b>
</p>

A motion to accept the orders of the day was carried as amended.

<p><b>2. Second Report of the Nominating Committee</b>
</p>

Colin Johnson, chair, presented the second report of the nominating committee for positions on standing committees. He noted that some changes had been made to add more visible minorities, representation from the Diocese of Brandon and the addition of the military ordinariate. The report was adopted.

<p>Some 60 positions were filled on the following committees:
<dl><dd>Eco-Justice<br>
Financial Management and Development<br>
Faith, Worship and Ministry<br>
Information Resources<br>
Partners in Mission<br>
Pensions
</dd></dl>
</p>

<p><b>2. Presentation by the Primate's Evangelism Commission</b>
</p>

The Primate introduced the report of the Primate's Evangelism Commission. Members of General Synod watched a video called <i>The 'E' Word</i>. Members then held table discussions on what they felt had changed, if anything, about their involvement or activity in the church during the Decade of Evangelism.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	General Synod then watched a video of interviews with members, shot earlier during Synod, in which people talked about how evangelism had changed them during the past decade. Members then heard live stories.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Rev. Marc Torchinsky, Diocese of Toronto, described his conversion from conservative Judaism to Christianity.


<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Elizabeth Daley, a new Christian, decribed her faith journey from lapsed protestant to Sunday school teacher at the Church of the Incarnation in Oakville, Ont.

	
<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prof. John Bowen, a member of the Primate's Commission on Evangelism invited members of General Synod to attend a conference on evangelism that is intended for teams of parish evangelists, to be held in May, 2002.

<p><b>3. Resolutions</b>
</p>
<p><b>A131 A New Agape</b>

nership with Indigenous Anglicans in Canada. Carried. Standing ovation.

<p><b>A132(b) revised Priorities for 2001-2004</b><br>

</p>

<p><b>4. Partners' Reflections</b>
</p>

The Right Rev. Dr. Sebastian Bakare told General Synod he saw many "parallels between your First Nations and the way my people in Zimbabwe were dispossessed." The Bishop of Manicaland commended the Canadian Church for how it has handled the issue and noted that in his own church, there had never been such reconciliation between black and white people.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Ruth Bakare, Diocese of Manicaland, spoke of the challenges facing women in Zimbabwe: AIDS, absentee husbands, limited education and few career choices.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Dr. Warren C. Ramshaw of the Episocpal Church of the USA thanked the Canadian church for the practical ideas his church has picked up from General Synod such as mailboxes, round tables and sequential numbering of resolutions. He offered suggestions for CoGS such as six-year non-renewable terms with half elected at each General Synod and holding CoGS meetings outside Toronto.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mr. Jimmy Iserhoff, Diocese of Moosonee, spoke of the highs of general Synod for him, such as the sermon by the Right Rev. Stephen Charleston, and the lows the feeling of alienation he initially felt although he added that the feeling had been alleviated by the forming of the sacred circle on Monday.

<BR>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Mrs. Verna Firth, co-chair of the Anglican Council of Indigenous People, noted the Charleston sermon, the Anglican-Lutheran service and the extension of time in the agenda to allow Indigenous people to share their stories. She expressed hope that Indigenous partners could be extended the right to vote on resolutions.
