</dd><br>
<br>

</dd><br>
<br>


<dd>b) any prior marriage in question has been validly dissolved or terminated in accordance with the law properly applicable thereto;
</dd><br>

<dd>a) If the incumbent is satisfied that efforts towards reconciliation between the parties to a former marriage would have been ineffective as a result of the fault of either party or for any other reason, the requirement of clause 28 c) may be dispensed with.
</dd><br>
<br>


<dd>b) If either applicant has entered into two or more marriages that have been dissolved, the incumbent may, before granting permission, seek the advice of other competent persons.
</dd><br>
<br>


<dd>c) If the incumbent is of the opinion that a prior purported marriage of an applicant did not constitute a marriage as defined by this Canon, the incumbent may refer the application to the Chancellor who may, if the conditions of Part III, section 20, are satisfied, make a declaration under that section in respect of the marriage in question.
</dd><br>
<br>


<dd>d) If an incumbent declines for reasons of conscience to entertain an application for permission to remarry, the incumbent shall refer the applicants to a priest designated by the bishop and, if that priest grants the application, shall permit that priest or another priest to solemnize the marriage in the incumbent's church.
</dd><br>
<br>


<dd>e) If an incumbent declines for reasons of conscience to solemnize a marriage pursuant to permission given under this Part, the incumbent shall refer the applicants to a priest designated by the bishop and shall permit that priest or another priest to solemnize the marriage in the incumbent's church.
