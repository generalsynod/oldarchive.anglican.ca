<p class="resSubj">Faith Worship and Ministry Report to General Synod Section II:  Tasks 1998-2001</p>



<p>Tasks are identified by a letter which indicates the working group which had responsibility for them.  C = Common tasks, E = Ethics, M = Ministry, R = Relationships (Inter-Church and Inter-Faith), T = Theology, and W = Worship.  For each task there is a page description of the mandate for it, who was involved, what developments took place, and what action, if any, General Synod is asked to take regarding it.  
</p>

<p>The 'ranking' of tasks by priority (high, medium, low) indicates the level of energy the Committee expected to have to spend on each one during the triennium.  In some cases, events proved them wrong, and in other cases there was simply a monitoring function for the committee.  In Section I is a listing of the priorities which the Committee considers it will need to address in the next triennium.

 <p><b><a href="#top" name="C1">Task	C1</a>	Aboriginal Cultures and Spiritualities </b>
</p>

<p><i>To work alongside the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples on the integration of traditions of aboriginal cultures and spiritualities in the life, ministry and worship of the Church.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Who Asked for it?:</b>	 The Strategic Plan; the Covenant of 1994; CoGS. General Synod 95, following up on the recommendations of the BAS Evaluation Commission requested that FWM propose liturgical texts for a eucharistic rite allowing local communities to explore native and other cultural traditions in Christian worship. FWM members after meeting with ACIP agreed that the prime responsibility for this area should rest with ACIP, but that the issues involved will continue to be part of FWM's work. CoGS asked FWM to identify information and worship resources for use on June 21 (National Aboriginal Day of Prayer). CoGS directed FWM in consultation with ACIP to 'collect, develop, and make available liturgical resources to assist the Church as it deals with the legacy of residential schools and furthers the ministry of healing and reconciliation'.
</p>

<p><b>Action(s) Requested of FWM:</b>  Consultation, and projects as mutually identified
</p>

<p><b>Priority:	high</b>
</p>

<p><b>FWM Member(s) Responsible:	Mark Loyal,</b> Eileen Scully
</p>
 
<p><b>Other People/Committees/Groups Involved:</b>	ACIP; Arthur Anderson and Lydia Constant; many people in dioceses; Helena Houldcroft, Laverne Jacobs

</p>
<p><b>Staff:</b>	Alyson, (Barbara), Eric, Donna Bomberry, Healing and Reconcilation staff team 
</p>

<p><b>Timeline:</b>	ongoing
</p>

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b>Liaison with ACIP was established through FWM member Mark Loyal.  FWM met with ACIP at the joint meeting of March 1999 to identify issues of mutual concern, including leadership development.  FWM is working with ACIP on determining priorities for translation of liturgical texts, translating the Baptismal Covenant, and gathering resources with respect to healing and reconciliation. Material was prepared and distributed to mark June 21 (distributed in the spring through Ministry Matters).  Grant of $1000 for 3 years made to First Nations Ecumenical Liturgical Resources group for work on 'Bridges in Spirituality'. A staff member and a committee member were part of the Sacred Circle held in August.  8 people involved in the liturgical consultations were aboriginal.  A report was prepared with regard to leadership development (see All staff have been writing and participating in discussions about racism and healing and reconciliation.  The Waterloo Declaration (R6) was translated into Swampy Cree and presented at the Diocese of Brandon synod using the circle method.
</p>

<p><b>Action Requested from this General Synod: </b> Engagement with aboriginal Anglicans at the Synod; participation in the healing service.
</p>

<p><b>Next Steps: </b> In reflecting on future planning, FWM considered it critical to continue to be committed to education and empowerment of local indigenous communities, the offering of indigenous models to the church, to work pro-actively to address potential anger in the future that might be directed at victims, and to facilitate translations of texts and resources into First Nations languages.  Resources will be collected and distributed by ACIP and FWM.</p>

 <p><b><a href="#top" name="E1">Task	E1</a>	 Biotechnologies</b>
</p>

<p><i>To work with EcoJustice on ethical issues related to biotechnologies</i>
</p>

<p><b>Who Asked for it?:	</b>Arose from Strategic Plan;CoGS
</p>
					
<p><b>Action(s) Requested of FWM:</b>	to establish a Biotechnologies Advisory Group, in consultation with the EcoJustice Committee, to examine issues arising from developments in biotechnology and its management (cloning of livestock, patenting of genetic material, etc.); include Anglicans involved in the scientific community, agriculture, ethics and other relevant areas; advise the Faith Worship and Ministry and EcoJustice Committees as to the implications of developments for Canadian Anglicans in response to government initiatives; be responsible to the Faith Worship and Ministry Committee, which would notify the Mission Coordination Group
</p>
 
<p><b>Priority:	high</b>
</p>
<p><b>FWM Member(s) Responsible:	David Gould</b>
</p>

<p><b>Other People/Committees/Groups Involved:	</b>EcoJustice, Mission Coordination Group; Anglicans across the country engaged in biotechonologies and/or ethical reflection about them..
</p>

<p><b>Staff:	</b>	Eric
</p>

<p><b>Timeline:</b>	ongoing
</p>

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b>Terms of reference were developed for two task groups being established, on in the west with a geneticist, a lawyer, and a farmer to address biotechnology in the food area, and one on application of biotechnology to human life and health in the east with a lawyer, ethicist and a physician.  Further action was limited by budgetary constraints, although some networking has taken place. The Canadian Council of Churches organized a Conference on Biotechnology and the Ethics Working Group reviewed the papers produced for it.  The primary focus is around issues of sustainable agriculture, food supply and safety, patenting of life forms, environment and biodiversity.  The ethics working group continues to monitor the work being done by ecumenical partners through the CCC's biotechnology reference group, which reports to both the commission on Faith and Witness and the Justice and Peace commission.  Letters were sent to the Prime Minister on two issues:  the potential patenting of life forms, and the cloning of embryos.  The government responded that it was taking up the position recommended by the church with respect to patenting. ECUSA organized a conference in New York at which Eric was a keynote speaker. The addresses from that conference will be published as a report. Eric has been asked to make his paper available to the Anglican Theological Review, and some elements of the conference will be distributed on the web. We continue to monitor the work being done by ecumenical partners through the CCC's biotechnology reference group, which reports to both the commission on Faith and Witness and the Justice and Peace commission.  Eric was asked to submit a brief on patenting of life forms to the Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee on behalf of the CCC. He is currently serving as a member of the Public Advisory Group, advising the government on a process of consultation around the possibility of allowing clinical trials for xenotransplantation. 
</p>

<p><b>Action Requested from this General Synod:</b>  FWM is bringing two resolutions to General Synod on biotechnology. <b>see Resolutions</b>  A 'conversation' will take place on biotechnology.
</p>

<p><b>Next Steps: </b> A network gathering relating to biotechnology is planned for later in 2001.
</p>

<p><b>Timeline:	</b>ongoing
</p>

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b> Rather than being a specific task, ethical theological reflection was part of the specific ethics tasks.
</p>

<p><b>Action Requested from this General Synod:</b>  none 
</p>

<p><b>Next Steps:</b>  Monitor ongoing discussion in Canadian society and help inform Anglicans as issues arise. If General Synod approves the resolution on a life forms task force, theological reflection will be part of the work, and theological reflection is part of the ongoing discussion of human sexuality.

</p>

<p><i>To assist Canadian Anglicans in reflecting on the ethical questions raised by euthanasia and assisted suicide, and to contribute to developing societal policies.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Who Asked for it?:	 </b>  The issue was handed on from the ethics sub committee of Doctrine and Worship; raised by a request from the Canadian Council of Churches.  General Synod 1998 commended the statement and supporting documentation (subject to further editing) to the church for study (Act 49).
</p>

<p><b>Action(s) Requested of FWM:</b> To make an edited form of the statement and study on Euthanasia available to the church for study and gather responses for a report to CoGS in March 1999.

</p>

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b> The Committee met in March 1999 with representatives of Fidelity and Integrity and all were encouraged by the spirit of their mutual dialogue.  The climate of patient respect and careful listening and speaking, the successful attempt to discern and articulate 'emerging common ground', the realization that the other is not the enemy, but that they share a common enemy of bigotry and hatred, encouraged the Committee to process in its work according to the same principles. Biblical scholars were invited to deepen the scriptural conversation on the broader questions of human sexuality. A resource is being prepared based on conversations with them. A letter was sent from the working group to dioceses reminding them of the resolution of General Synod and of CoGS deploring bigotry and violence against gays and lesbians.  Eric has made presentations and/or met with commissions in several dioceses, and has been a consultant to the commission in the diocese of New Westminster.  A meeting of representatives from dioceses was held January 26-29, 2001 and a report brought to the Council of General Synod.

<p><b>Developments to March '01:  </b>Phyllis Creighton has been invited by Health Canada to attend discussions about the possibility of changing the moratorium on these technologies to a prohibition.  The ethics working group reviewed the document sent by the federal government as preparatory information indicating the direction of planned legislation.  A number of concerns were raised over areas where this document seems to back off from commitments that were enshrined in bill C-47.  There was also a lack of clarity over some of the items in the suggested list of practices that would be made illegal.  For example it may not be a good idea to prohibit the combination of human and animal genetic material in the context of an attempt to produce tissues for transplant that are acceptable to human immune systems.  On the other hand there would be widespread rejection of the use transfer of genes from other organisms into human persons.  Eric wrote to health minister Allan Rock, based on our earlier interventions, reports and policy statements, raising questions and requesting good notice for consultation when the new legislation is introduced.  It was agreed that our position on these issues has consistently been that some practices should be prohibited and others regulated.  The failure to secure adequate legislation would not be desirable.  Consistent with materials produced in the past concerns will be expressed over commercialization of reproductive health services and reproductive materials, the identification of persons who are vulnerable.

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b> FWM conducted a feasibility study on 'core curriculum' for theological education, and on the basis of its findings established a Theological Education Task Force.  This included the members of the feasibility study together with 2 bishops, a lay adult education consultant, a college educator from the Atlantic region, two members of ACIP and the indigenous ministries co-ordinator. A process to consult regarding competencies and expectations, was designed by Richard Leggett and Patricia Bays, and an initial gathering was held in September 1999. The chief aim was to develop a consultative, collaborative process which keep all the stakeholders:  bishops, educators, students, laity, in conversation with each other, rather than develop a list of courses and requirements.  The process was presented to the House of Bishops in October and is commended for use in dioceses, particularly with committees mandated for ministry and postulancy.  It is designed to be highly adaptable for use at all levels of the church. A follow up meeting of the Task Force produced a Report of the Task Force on Theological Education for Ordained Ministry which was presented to the House of Bishops and the Council of General Synod in the fall of 2000. As a follow-up, FWM has prepared a questionnaire which has been sent to bishops, provincial and diocesan ministry committees, and heads of colleges and training institutions with the report.

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b> The ARC Dialogue (Canada) dialogue is working on a response to the agreed statement of ARCIC II, Gift of Authority, which was published in the spring of 1999.  It prepared a survey of Anglican Roman Catholic relations in Canada in preparation for the leaders' meeting in Mississauga which was held at the request of the Archbishop of Canterbury and Cardinal Cassidy.   The Bishops' Dialogue, which celebrated 25 years in November 2000, completed its response to the papal encyclical on the papacy, <i>Ut Unum Sint</i>, and sent it to the House of Bishops for information before being sending it to Rome. Issues raised by the letter from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, <i>Dominus Iesus</i>, and the 'note' on sister churches were discussed by both the theological dialogue and the bishops' dialogue in November.  The theological dialogue prepared a response which was sent to the Council of General Synod for information.  The Mississauga meeting and <i>Dominus Iesus</i> both generated great interest in the press, and the national and diocesan ecumenical officers were quite involved in responding to requests for interviews and interpretation.

Memorials from dioceses which took synodical action with respect to Waterloo are also included. Members of the JWG and ecumenical officers were involved in many educational events on this proposed relationship, in parishes, deaneries, dioceses, Lutheran conventions, and theological colleges.  The House of Bishops continued to meet annually with the ELCIC Conference of Bishops.

<p><b>Developments to March '01:</b>  An emergency meeting of the CCJC was called in the fall to discuss the response of the churches to the recent crisis in the Middle East. A modified version of a letter prepared by the CCC's Middle East Working Group was sent out. Meanwhile the primate wrote personally to the Bishop of Jerusalem expressing his concern and support for them in their current situation, and a resolution was prepared by the Partners in Mission Committee and approved by the Council of General Synod.  A sub-committee of the Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation collected prayers from Yom Kippur to create a liturgy to be used in Christian churches in solidarity with the Jewish community. It is clear that it is not an attempt to have Christians appropriate Yom Kippur, but it is to be an act of Christian prayer in solidarity.
</p>

<p><b>Action Requested from this General Synod: </b> None.
</p>

<p><b>Next Steps: </b> It is becoming increasingly clear that the CJC may not be the ideal dialogue partner for conversation between the two religious communities since the CJC generally functions rather as an advocacy organization especially in areas of concern to the nation of Israel. There needs to be some exploration as to whether it would be better to interact with the councils of rabbis, a model recently adopted by the NCC in the USA.

<p><b>Developments to March '01: </b> United Church of Canada: Four regional meetings were held (in Regina, Vancouver, Belleville, and Halifax) to explore possible Anglican-United Church relations.  As a result of encouraging messages from those gatherings, a national dialogue network has been set up with representatives from each of the regional groups, which meets by conference call.  Its purpose is to provide a place for matters of mutual interest to be discussed.  Members of FWM were invited to respond to a request from the Inter Church Inter Faith Committee of the United Church regarding proposed alternatives to the baptismal formula.  The ICIF Committee considered Anglican responses, and the report of the RC/UC dialogue on the Trinity, and recommended that the United Church General Council Executive not authorize new baptismal formulae for their new book of worship resources, and the Executive concurred with this recommendation. The <b>Metropolitan Community Church </b>asked that the Anglican Church of Canada consider an ecumenical relationship with them.  Diocesan ecumenical officers in dioceses which have MCC parishes were asked to make contact with them, as a preliminary step in getting to know one another.  Canadian Anglican Bruce Matthews, Dean of Religious Studies at Acadia University, serves on the <b>International Anglican Baptist Forum</b>, which was established at the request of Lambeth 1998 and which has met twice.
