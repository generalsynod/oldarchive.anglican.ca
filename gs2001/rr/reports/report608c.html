<p class="resSubj">PWRDF -- REPORT TO GENERAL SYNOD</p>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The last three years have been among
the most important in the institutional life and evolution of The
Primate's World Relief and Development Fund, a period of transition
and of significant change in PWRDF. During this triennium, PWRDF
celebrated its fortieth anniversary of social action in Canada and
around the world as the international development ministry of the
Anglican Church of Canada. As PWRDF approached this major
anniversary, the PWRDF staff and National Committee experienced a
major loss with the deaths of Robin Gibson, our Director, and John
Vandenburg, our Program Coordinator for Asia/Pacific in late 1998.
The loss of these two friends and colleagues had a profound effect on
the staff, volunteers and partners of PWRDF. Soon after, PWRDF
entered its fifth decade with the arrival of the new Executive
Director, Andrew Ignatieff, in August 1999.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">At the same time, the PWRDF National
Committee made the decision to seek incorporation as a charitable
not-for-profit corporation working in close association with the
Anglican Church of Canada. Even with this new organizational status
of The Primate's World Relief and Development Fund, PWRDF retains its
role as the active international development ministry of the Anglican
Church of Canada through its networks of faithful volunteers
representing PWRDF in parishes and communities in every part of
Canada.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">This Report to General Synod is the
last one that will be coming to General Synod from the PWRDF National
Committee as a Standing Committee of General Synod. As you will see
from the Handbook Concerns Working Group report, the Constitution of
General Synod has been altered, deleting all references to PWRDF
National Committee. At the General Synod 2001, you will receive a
motion from the PWRDF National Committee requesting that the PWRDF
National Committee be dissolved as a Standing Committee of General
Synod and seeking acknowledgment from General Synod of the
incorporation of PWRDF as The Primate's World Relief and Development
Fund/ Le fonds du Primat pour le secours et le d&eacute;veloppement
mondial.  PWRDF was federally incorporated in June 2000 with the
latter name, reflecting our organization's operations within Canada's
bilingual reality.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">While undergoing this change in its
relation to General Synod, PWRDF remains an organization committed to
a vision of international development and global justice that is
founded on theological reflection and a faith-based analysis</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Mandate and Governance</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The PWRDF National Committee has
continued to operate through the latest triennium to provide support
and oversight to the work of The Primate's Fund, the international
development ministry of the Anglican Church of Canada. The PWRDF
National Committee has carried out its work in the spirit of the
mission statement developed earlier for PWRDF:</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">PWRDF is a response by
Canadian Anglicans to the gospel call to bear witness to God's
healing love in a broken world. Inspired by a vision of a spirit
filled community of hope, PWRDF walks together with partners in
Canada and overseas, to share in the creation of a more just and
peaceful world. In joy and struggle, the Primate's Fund engages in
development work, responds to emergencies, works to protect refugees,
and educates and advocates for change.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The PWRDF staff and the PWRDF National
Committee do indeed constitute the 'spirit filled community of hope'
referred to in the mission statement. The quality of our lives as a
spirit filled community of hope has been especially important in the
last three years, as PWRDF has had challenges as we have rarely
experienced in our forty years of existence. These institutional
challenges present themselves at a time when the world is undergoing
profound, unsettling change as a consequence of globalization, severe
economic hardship for the majority of the world's population,
environmental change, natural disasters, and armed conflicts.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The PWRDF National Committee, with
Marion Saunders as Chair, is made up of eighteen members, including a
bishop, clergy and laity, three aboriginal partners representing the
Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples (ACIP) and our aboriginal
development partners, as well as three international members
representing our development partners in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America. This membership on the National Committee has ensured a rich
debate on the many issues before the National Committee in carrying
out its responsibilities for oversight of the work of The Primate's
Fund.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">During this triennium, the work of the
National Committee has been carried out during plenary sessions of
the Committee, complemented by the work of sub-committees whose work
focuses on Africa, Asia/Pacific/Global, Latin America/Caribbean,
Canadian Development Program, Parish and Diocesan Partnership
Program, Refugees and Emergencies. In addition, Task Forces have been
convened and have deliberated over the three years on policy issues
of special concern to the National Committee, such as Gender and
Development, Culture of Inclusion, Ecumenical Coalitions
Re-structuring, Environment. This combination of more focussed
deliberations and decision-making within the smaller groups with the
broader sweep of public policy and strategic planning debates has
enabled the PWRDF National Committee to carry out most of the work
plan which it set for itself at the beginning of the triennium
despite the many institutional situations which arose during the
three years.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Policy Discussions and Decisions</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Gender and Development</B> - The
gender and development task force re-visited work done by an earlier
task force during the previous triennium. In order to deepen
under-standing of the issues and processes of involving women and men
equally in the tasks of development, as well as to ensure application
of these gender and development principles and processes to the PWRDF
program and operations, the PWRDF staff and members of the PWRDF
National Committee reviewed the existing policy and developed an
analytical framework for use in monitoring and evaluation of PWRDF
supported projects. This program and policy debate provided an
opportunity for staff to analyze the impact of gender considerations
on the operations of PWRDF as well as working relations within the
PWRDF community.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Culture of Inclusion</B> - While
motivated initially by PWRDF's compliance with the Code of Ethics of
the Canadian Council for International Co-operation, PWRDF staff and
the PWRDF National Committee have devoted considerable research,
discussion, analysis, debate time and resources to the development of
a culture of inclusion policy for PWRDF, which would affect its
operations in Canada as well as its working relations with partners
in Canada and overseas. The task force was able to develop an
extensive policy database, assess inclusion work done by other
development organizations and to assess the needs for such a policy
within PWRDF. At the same time, PWRDF staff worked closely with
colleagues from General Synod, working on comparable inclusion
initiatives. Because of the complexity of the issues and the strength
of feeling among both staff and Committee members, the debates on the
culture of inclusion were among the most profound of this triennium.
At its final meeting in April 2001, the PWRDF National
Committee/Board of Directors approved the following policy statement:</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<table border="1" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>
<H2><I>Culture
of Inclusion Policy</I></H2>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">
<I><B>Definition of Inclusion</B> - PWRDF is committed to and is
creating a diverse organization that is free of all forms of
discrimination on the basis of: age, sex, sexual orientation, family
or marital status, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, ancestry,
disability, creed, socio-economic status or conviction for an offence
for which a pardon has been granted.</I></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Representation</B>
- PWRDF actively recruits and develops participation at all levels of
the organization, including Board, Staff, Partners, Donors and
Volunteers, that reflects a broad range of diversity and strives to
create inclusive environments that are free of harassment and foster
full participation.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">
<I><B>Policy</B> - PWRDF works to ensure that all programs are
consistent with the Inclusion Policy.</I></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">
<I><B>Communication and Education</B> - Communications present a
positive and balanced portrayal of the range of diverse communities

content, offensive language or imagery. PWRDF educates to raise
awareness of inclusion issues and to promote positive change.</I></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">
<I><B>Program</B> - PWRDF ensures that all programs are consistent
with the Inclusion Policy and collaborates with equity-seeking groups
in Canada and internationally to address and transform all forms of
systemic discrimination.</I></P>

<P><BR>

</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Ecumenical Coalitions Re-structuring</B>
- The discussions within this task force have been critical in
advancing the process for re-structuring the ecumenical social
justice coalitions. The task force reviewed the work of earlier
attempts at ecumenical coalitions re-structuring, carried out an
informal assessment of the work of the different coalitions and their
relations with the Anglican Church of Canada and other participating
churches, as well as identifying the needs and gaps which existed in
ecumenical social justice work in Canada. This ground-breaking work
enabled the staff of PWRDF and the Partnerships department to take
the initiative in mobilizing their counterparts in the participating
churches as well as the staff and volunteers of the different
ecumenical coalitions to take the re-structuring further than had
been attempted previously.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Domestic Emergencies Policy</B> -
PWRDF has traditionally focussed its work on emergencies on its
international commitments. However, following a number of
unprecedented environmental emergencies such as:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">flooding in the Saguenay valley;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">the Ontario/Quebec ice storm;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">flooding of the Red River; and</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">recurring drought on the Prairies,</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">members of our constituency asked the
PWRDF National Committee to develop a policy response to this issue
of concern throughout the Anglican Church of Canada. Staff and
members of the Refugees and Emergencies sub-committee consulted
widely among the dioceses, reflected on the needs and gaps in
existing PWRDF policies and programs, and developed a policy which
will assist in decision-making in the event of future environ-mental
emergencies in Canada. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Environment</B> - Discussions around
an environment policy for PWRDF have been motivated by our concern
for environmental issues raised through PWRDF's ecumenical
participation on environmental issues as well as the requirements of
our funding relations with the Canadian International Development
Agency. Task force discussions have centred around the development of
a policy statement and a monitoring tool to evaluate PWRDF projects.
Work on these important issues have continued while PWRDF has been
actively involved in environmental education, information and
communication work through its participation in the Canadian
Ecumenical Jubilee Initiative.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; page-break-before: always"><B>Advocacy
Policy review</B> - The Advocacy Policy of the Anglican Church of
Canada was reviewed within PWRDF as part of a larger review,
conducted during this triennium at the request of the Mission
Coordination Group. Staff and members of the PWRDF National Committee
consulted with other departments of General Synod and the broader
Anglican Church of Canada in order to assess the implementation of
the policy and procedures related to advocacy on issues of concern to
the national church as well as issues which form part of the broad
national debate. Through research and analysis of specific
situations, which have occurred within PWRDF, the PWRDF National
Committee came to the conclusion that measures outlined were more in
the nature of procedures rather than an advocacy policy. Further work
is necessary to outline the levels of urgency of response, the
appropriate levels of authorization so that the Anglican Church of
Canada can respond promptly, effectively, and appropriately with
advocacy statements around issues of injustice.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<H3>PWRDF Incorporation</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The most significant event in the
recent history of PWRDF has been the process of incorporation, which
has taken up the majority of time of the National Committee and some
PWRDF staff during the last triennium. The challenging situation of
the national church encouraged the PWRDF National Committee to look
at means of clarifying the institutional relations between the
Primate's World Relief and Development Fund and the General Synod.
This initiative received further encouragement from the Canadian
International Development Agency in its most recent institutional
evaluation, which included recommendations around the need for
clarification of the working administra-tive relations with General
Synod. After due reflection and extensive discussions, the PWRDF
National Committee recommended that PWRDF seek incorporation as a
separate non-share capital corporation working on the implementation
of the develop-ment program in Canada and overseas, in close
cooperation with the Anglican Church of Canada.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">From the outset, the PWRDF National
Committee and the PWRDF staff worked on the process of incorporation
with the following institutional goals:</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">PWRDF should retain its Anglican
	identity;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">PWRDF should be able to fulfill
	its long term commitments to its development partners in Canada and
	internationally;</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">PWRDF should be able to guarantee
	the intent of all donations and contributions made to PWRDF by its
	faithful donors as well as other contributors.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Now that the process of incorporation
is complete, the PWRDF National Committee/ Board of Directors can
affirm wholeheartedly that these institutional goals have been met. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Once the decision to seek incorporation
had been made by the PWRDF National Committee and affirmed by the
Council of General Synod in the autumn of 1999, the PWRDF National
Committee worked with staff through the early months of 2000 on the
writing of Letters Patent and a comprehensive By-law for PWRDF. With
the permission of the Council of General Synod at its May 2000
meeting in Fredericton, PWRDF proceeded with an application for
incorporation to Industry Canada. As PWRDF sought federal
incorporation as a national institution, on May 30, 2000, PWRDF was
granted incorporation as The Primate's World Relief and Development
Fund/ Le fonds du Primat pour le secours et le d&eacute;veloppement
mondial. PWRDF sought registration with the Canada Customs and
Revenue Agency and qualification for tax-exempt charitable status,
which was received effective September 1, 2000. Subsequently,
comparable tax-exempt status was obtained from Revenue Quebec. With
this charitable status, PWRDF has been able to issue its own
charitable receipts for donations received since September 2000.
Thus, the formalities of incorporation were completed in a very short
timeframe through the diligence and cooperation of PWRDF staff and
members of the PWRDF National Committee.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The first directors of the new
corporation began to meet immediately following incorpor-ation in
June 2000 and the first full meeting of the Board of Directors was
held in October 2000. In order to ensure a smooth transition, the
membership of the PWRDF National Committee was retained as the first
Directors of the new corporation with the same balance of a bishop,
clergy, and laity, aboriginal and international development partners.
As the PWRDF National Committee can only be dissolved as a result of
a resolution presented and approved by General Synod, the PWRDF
National Committee has continued to function, only making decisions
surrounding the preparations for General Synod. The <I>new</I> PWRDF
Board of Directors has made the majority of decisions since October
2000. The Board of Directors is now devoting considerable attention
to the issues of governance, specifically the creation of the
essential standing committees of the new Board of Directors. A
Memorandum of Understanding has been negotiated by the PWRDF
Executive Director with the General Secretary, which clearly and
succinctly outlines all administrative aspects of the daily working
relations between PWRDF and General Synod.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">PWRDF staff has devoted considerable
time to the establishment of separate bank accounts and the
development of its financial management policies and procedures. This
has been done with the support and close cooperation of the Treasurer
and Financial Management and Development staff of General Synod. The
accumulated funds previously reported as PWRDF deferred revenue have
been expended as of December 31, 2000. At the same time as paying
down this deferred revenue in General Synod accounts, PWRDF has built
up its own bank accounts through sound budgeting and financial
management so that it can stand by its commitments to its development
partners and guarantee the intent of all donations and contributions.
Special mention should be made of our generous donors in parishes
throughout Canada, who have sustained PWRDF throughout this period of
transition.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Key to the process of incorporation has
been the discussion and decision-making around the issue of
membership in the new PWRDF. Very early in the discussions, the PWRDF
National Committee decided that the dioceses of the Anglican Church
of Canada should be designated as the voting members in the new
corporation along with the members of the new Board of Directors,
which retains its composition of a bishop, clergy and laity,
aboriginal and international partners. The Primate of the Anglican
Church of Canada is also a voting member of the new corporation, The
Primate's World Relief and Development Fund/ Le fonds du Primat pour
le secours et le d&eacute;veloppement mondial. The By-law of the new
corporation provides clear opportunity for the dioceses to select
their own person to act as their Diocesan Representative at the
Annual General Meeting and to represent the interests of the dioceses
in the decisions being made at the Annual General Meeting. The first
Annual General Meeting will be held in early November 2001.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Issues of membership raised during the
process of incorporation have underlined the importance of the unique
resource available to PWRDF through its networks of Diocesan PWRDF
and Refugee Coordinators and Parish Representatives, working on
behalf of the international development ministry of the Anglican
Church of Canada in communities across Canada. Incorporation has
emphasized the importance of the Parish and Diocesan Partnership
Program (PDPP). Throughout the incorporation process, PDPP staff have
worked with the PDPP sub-committee of the PWRDF National Committee,
looking at models of organization to strengthen the education,
communication, information and social action work done by the PWRDF
networks, working denominationally within the church as well as
ecumenically in cooperation with other churches in their communities.
In the coming months, staff will be working on a model for the PWRDF
networks which will be based on participatory, informed
decision-making and action around issues of concern for PWRDF and our
development partners in Canada and internationally. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The model developed for approval by the
Board of Directors will be focussed around institutional
strengthening with the following goals in mind:</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<OL START=0>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">To strengthen PWRDF as an
	institution within the Anglican Church of Canada through coordinated
	strategies of information, communication, education, and training
	with representatives of PWRDF networks within the parishes and
	dioceses across Canada; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">To strengthen PWRDF as an
	institution through effective participatory processes of information
	sharing, decision-making, activity planning and implementation
	involving all levels of the PWRDF networks; 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">To strengthen PWRDF as an
	institution by ensuring that PWRDF volunteers at all levels within
	the PWRDF networks join with staff in becoming effective
	represen-tatives and spokespersons for PWRDF on issues of social
	justice within the Anglican Church of Canada, the ecumenical social
	justice movement within Canada and internationally as well as with
	the general public in Canada.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In conclusion, it must be emphasized
that the process of incorporation has been both positive and
transformative in the best sense of the words. The process of
incorporation has encouraged the PWRDF National Committee/Board of
Directors, the PWRDF staff, the PWRDF networks and all others
involved in this process to reflect on our essential values as an
organization, our relations with the Anglican Church of Canada which
gave us life, and the nature of our partnership relations in Canada
and internationally which give us our reason for being. The process
of incorporation has given us the opportunity to affirm these
essential values and relations, to make the necessary administrative
changes which will enhance our effectiveness as an organization, to
create a sound institutional basis which will enable PWRDF to move
into the future in a sound position to continue to act as the
international development ministry of the Anglican Church of Canada.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Strategic Planning</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Through the latter part of the
triennium, the PWRDF National Committee worked alongside the PWRDF
staff as they worked on the outline of a new strategic plan for
PWRDF. This has been an important process for both staff and
Committee members in clarifying the broader aims of The Primate's
Fund as well as some of the processes and policies necessary for
attaining these institutional aims. Though time-consuming, the
strategic planning process has been truly informative and encouraging
of profound reflection on the part of both PWRDF National Committee
members and PWRDF staff. Both staff and Committee members explored
the theological meaning of the work of PWRDF and the interpretation
of the overarching themes, which make the connections between the
many activities of PWRDF. The themes, which have emerged from the
current strategic planning process, are as follows:</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal"><I>Weaving a culture of peace with

<H3>PWRDF Program</H3>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">PWRDF continues to implement a
comprehensive program of support to projects implemented by our
development partners in Canada and internationally. The challenges
that PWRDF is addressing play themselves out in different degrees in
different regions. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In <B>Asia</B>, the economic boom that
was experienced until the bubble burst in 1997 was characterized by
high rates of economic growth in many countries in the region.
However, it also contributed to the destruction of existing local
economies in favour of global priorities. This has led to
environmental degradation (from tailings dams and massive hydro
projects), a lack of basic social services related to the high burden
of debt and an outflow of people in search of work to countries
overseas where, as migrant labourers, they are vulnerable to
exploitation and abuse. Others migrate to large cities where they
seek work at low wages in industries focussed on processing exports.
Women are particularly affected by these trends.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">According to the United Nations
Development Program's 2000 Report on Human Development, <B>Latin
America's</B> greatest weaknesses continue to be increasing levels of
poverty and fragile democracies. Here, too, economic liberalization
has taken its toll in bankruptcy of national industries, the ruin of
small and medium sized farms, the robbery of indigenous knowledge,
the outflow of natural resources, environmental destruction and
malnutrition, illiteracy, a lack of basic social services and
over-exploitation of the workforce. No Latin American country has
achieved a level of inclusive democracy that measures not only
regularly held elections, but also independent media, separation of
state powers, citizen participation, and the basic human rights of
women, youth, children, indigenous people and ethnic or racial
minorities.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Africa</B> finds the challenges it
is facing to be deeper still because, by and large, it has not
benefitted from the dubious &quot;advantages&quot; of globalization
seen in other regions of the Global South. Not a single sub-Saharan
African country is listed among the top 100 countries in the UNDP's
Human Development Index. All but six of the 37 countries ranked as
having &quot;low human development&quot; are in sub-Saharan Africa.
The lowest 22 are all in Africa. Africa's people remain the most
poverty stricken in the world. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria,
sleeping sickness, cholera, meningitis and plague are often at
epidemic proportions. Unlike other regions, there has been virtually
no global investment in even low wage manufacturing, but extraction
of Africa's mineral wealth is proceeding virtually unabated. The
impact of debt is as severe in Africa as anywhere. And, added to
these problems, as the Cold War ended and Western-style democracies
were imposed on Africa, the exploitation of ethnic rivalries in the
search for power has brought horrendous ethno-political conflicts
with genocide and other crimes against humanity in too many African
countries. When combined with climatic changes resulting in severe
droughts and massive flooding, the challenges faced by Africans are
daunting.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">In <B>Canada</B>, PWRDF is working with
indigenous communities through its Canadian Development Program
within the broader framework of the emerging partnership relationship
between the Anglican Church of Canada and the indigenous peoples in
every part of the land. Indigenous communities continue to experience
economic marginal-ization and social disintegration, which is
characterized by low levels of participation in the national economy,
high unemployment, poverty, cultural dislocation, challenges to
family cohesion, dependency, limited educational attainment, poor
health standards, mental health problems, substance abuse, inadequate
housing and high levels of incar-ceration. At the same time as facing
these many challenges, indigenous people from across this land are
working for the recognition of their legitimate rights and
self-determination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">PWRDF staff and National Committee
members look back with considerable pride on PWRDF's involvement with
the Canadian Ecumenical Jubilee Initiative (CEJI), which has
coincided with this triennium. Working with our ecumenical partners
has provided PWRDF with the opportunity to achieve greater impact in
our policy development and social action work, especially on policy
change around international debt cancellation and international
finance as well as awareness raising about aboriginal land rights.
Our ecumenical work with our CEJI partners has introduced PWRDF to a
wide range of new regional and international partners working on
social and economic justice issues through the global Jubilee
movement.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">The principal area of work has been
PWRDF staff involvement in the re-structuring of the ten ecumenical
social justice coalitions. This re-structuring has been attempted
several times before through individual re-mandating of the
coalitions. However, the participating churches have approached this
attempt with a greater sense of urgency brought about by the
situations of the individual churches and the pressing nature of a
deteriorating socio-economic situation throughout our world as a
result of globalization, armed conflicts, human rights abuses and
deterioration of our global environment. Though all churches have
participated equally in this process of re-structuring, it must be
recognized that this initiative was moved forward at the outset by
the shared concerns of staff from PWRDF and the Partnerships
Department of General Synod from the Anglican Church of Canada. They
have received the consistent support from the respective committees
of General Synod, including the PWRDF National Committee.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">After two years of consistent,
sustained work on re-structuring, there is now one ecumenical social
justice coalition, with the provisional title of <I>Canadian Churches
for Justice and Peace (CCJP).</I> This single coalition amalgamates
the work previously done by the ten social justice coalition under
the direction of a Board of Directors, with representatives of the
participating churches, including the Executive Director of PWRDF.
There is now an Executive Director of CCJP responsible for program
administration and coordination of the activities of staff in the
five different program areas: international human rights,
environment, aboriginal issues, social development issues in Canada,
and economic justice. A process of reconfiguring the existing staff
complement will be completed by July 1, 2001. The Board of Directors
are currently developing organizational models which will allow for
effective decision-making and management of resources so as to ensure
the on-going work of the former coalitions, the development of a
truly national bilingual presence for this ecumenical social justice
work, the assurance of a significant component of national education
and social action on the issues covered in this ecumenical mandate,
as well as opportunities for national participation and engagement in
the work of this new coalition.</P>
