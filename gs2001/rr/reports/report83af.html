<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These five principles have been adopted
by the World Association for Christian Communication, and we learned
of them early during the triennium. We hope they have guided us
through a time of both significant progress and significant upheaval.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Highlights and achievements:</I></P>
<OL START=0>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The triennium began with the
	launch of <I>Common Praise,</I> born, as all hymnbooks are, amid
	controversy. The book, now in its third printing, has been warmly
	embraced across the church. More than 100,000 copies of the
	full-music edition have been sold. A words-only edition, released
	late last year, is now in its second printing, having sold more than
	20,000 copies.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anglican Book Centre sales (not
	counting <I>Common Praise</I>) increased through the triennium. Last
	year the combined operations of the publishing and retailing
	operation contributed net $430,000 to General Synod's overall
	revenue (unaudited figures). Although ABC is justly known as a
	comprehensive source for Christian resources - with more than 25,000
	titles in stock, representing more than 1,200 religious publishers -
	it's worth noting that fully a third of our sales come from our own
	ABC publications. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We are pleased by consistent
	reports from customers of excellent service received from a
	knowledgeable and courteous sales staff. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">August this year will see ABC
	Publishing launch <I>Path Books</I>, a new imprint offering
	practical spirituality to enrich everyday living. We hope with this
	new line to increase our service to the seekers in our midst.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">August will also see a gathering
	of diocesan bookstore managers at the invitation of, and partially
	hosted by, ABC. This is a professional development event that will
	also help enhance our good relationships with these important
	diocesan partners.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The <I>Anglican Journal</I>
	continued to win professional recognition as one of the finest
	church publications in North America, receiving numerous prestigious
	awards from the international Associated Church Press and from the
	Canadian Church Press. Last year these organizations awarded it
	first prizes for General Excellence and Best of Class, respectively.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The <I>Journal</I> has worked to
	keep church members well informed during this tumultuous time.
	Readership response has been extremely positive. Response to the
	Journal financial appeal, in particular, has exceeded expectations. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During the triennium we said
	goodbye to the Rev. David Harris, who had guided the Journal since
	1996, and welcomed Sam Carriere as editor, beginning with the
	October 2000 issue. Mr. Carriere also continues as editor of the
	popular magazine <I>Ministry</I>Matters.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Ministry</I>Matters produced a
	special issue called <I>Residential Schools: Legacy and Hope</I>, in
	January 2000. This has provided a basic resource for individuals and
	parishes wishing to learn more about the history of the schools, and
	about our church's response. It has also been widely distributed, by
	request, to members of other churches and to the Aboriginal
	community.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We have significantly increased
	resources available to support the growth of our web site,
	<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U>www.anglican.ca</U></FONT>, making it
	increasingly useful as a tool of communication and ministry. We make
	the full text of the <I>Anglican Journal</I> and <I>Ministry</I>Matters
	available on the web. An email subscription list allows anyone to
	receive copies of our news releases automatically. Access to
	research databases is planned.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the restructuring imposed by
	staff reductions late last year, the web staff were combined with
	<I>Anglican Journal </I>editorial staff into a News and Information
	group, an attempt to use the limited staff resources more
	efficiently. The <I>Journal</I>'s mandate as an independent
	editorial voice was unaffected.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Anglican Video completed
	production of <I>Great Pilgrimages</I>, its second documentary
	intended for secular audiences. <I>Great Pilgrimages</I> was
	broadcast on ABC affiliated stations in the fall of 2000. The
	original documentary in the series, <I>The Power Within: Healing
	through Prayer</I>, was broadcast on the Odyssey network (U.S.) this
	past January. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The documentary series was
	suspended in the August 2000 budget reductions. However, a
	distributor is continuing to negotiate broadcast contracts and video
	sales for both productions. For example, <I>Great Pilgrimages</I>
	has been bought by a European broadcaster, for use next year; and
	<I>The Power Within</I> will be dubbed into Spanish for a consortium
	of South American broadcasters.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Among the resource (non-broadcast)
	productions completed by Anglican Video in the past year are:
	<I>Northern Ministry, An Anglican Challenge</I>, produced for the
	Council of the North, with the assistance of Anglican Appeal;
	<I>Residential Schools Litigation: Information and Perspectives</I>,
	produced for the diocesan consultations last year, and widely used
	in parishes; <I>Sexual Misconduct: How to Spot It; How to Stop It</I>,
	produced for the Diocese of Toronto (this video has received an
	award from the International Film and Video Association); <I>Walking
	a New Vision</I>, for the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples, a
	documentary about the Sacred Circle gathering in August last year;
	and a yet-to-be-titled video you will see at the beginning of
	General Synod, that attempts to highlight some defining moments in
	the life of the church since 1998.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We adopted a set of operating
	guidelines for both broadcast and non-broadcast video productions,
	to clarify and codify existing practice.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A common database for the whole of
	Church House came online during the triennium, allowing greater
	accuracy and efficiency. The committee developed policy for the use
	of the database, and recommended appropriate security measures. A
	significant portion of the 2001 Anglican Church Directory was
	produced from the database. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We approved a copyright manual for
	distribution to diocesan archivists.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We have been involved in
	contingency planning, as part of a response to the residential
	schools litigation, to determine ways in which the church as a whole
	may be able to retain some common facilities in the event that
	General Synod becomes insolvent. Specifically, we have looked at
	particular courses of action through which: the Anglican Book Centre
	can continue to function, possibly as a co-op structure; the
	Anglican Journal can continue its dual roles as a national
	newspaper, and as a circulation and distribution vehicle for
	diocesan papers; and the integrity of the General Synod archives can
	be maintained as a unified collection.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We participated during our regular
	meetings in a number of continuing education sessions designed to
	help us remain aware of current thinking and best practices. These
	included: <I>Christian Principles of Communication</I>, assisted by
	the Rev. Randy Naylor (then) Director of Communications, National
	Council of Churches (USA); <I>Developing web strategy</I>, assisted
	by Andy Lang, Web Editor, United Church of Christ; and <I>Crisis
	Communication and Management</I>, assisted by Mr. Ross Perry,
	Enterprise Canada.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We reviewed our terms of reference
	and mandates, and noted that this is the first triennium of a
	revised structure. While we have no proposals for further change at
	this time, we have noted some more flexible operating styles to
	experiment with in the next triennium. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We completed a review of our
	communications strategy in our February 2001 meeting and have
	proposed an outline of strategy going forward in the next triennium.
	This outline is appended. It will be a subject of conversation with
	committee members and staff during this General Synod meeting.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<H3>Concerns</H3>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the beginning of this triennium
	we expressed to the Council of General Synod our concern about the
	adequacy of the work environment at 600 Jarvis Street, including
	retail space. At the conclusion we note the continuing and
	intensifying pressure on staff arising from the budget cuts of the
	past August. We have expressed to the Council of General Synod our
	continuing concern about the long-term effect of overwork on staff
	health, and about our ability to preserve essential services.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">All areas of General Synod work
	have been affected by last year's reductions. The impact on staff
	complement has been most intense in the Information Resources area.
	In response the Archives and Library are operating with reduced
	hours, and the Anglican Journal is publishing fewer pages, among
	other effects. Archives and Library, in particular, are stretched to
	maintain basic areas of their mandates. These facilities, in our
	view, represent basic infrastructure, and they are in danger. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The closing of the Resource Centre
	represents the loss of a piece of infrastructure, to the keen
	disappointment of many. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the fall of 1999 we asked the
	Council of General Synod to mandate the creation of an Information
	Technology Strategy for Church House. Council approved this request,
	but no subsequent action was taken. We continue to believe that an
	information technology strategy is needed.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Despite these concerns, we are grateful
for the many achievements of the year. Speaking for the committee,
and for myself, we are extremely grateful for the dedicated work that
has been done, and continues to be done, by our professional staff.
We look forward to continuing to serve the church in the next
triennium.</P>
