<p class="resSubj">The Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples</p>

<P><B>I.  MANDATE and HISTORY</B></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><I>It has been the philosophy
and spirituality of Indigenous ministry with the Anglican Church of
Canada to strengthen and support the Indigenous Peoples of Canada,
(Aboriginal, Inuit and Metis) spiritually, socially, economically and
politically in line with our needs and aspirations by recognizing
that the purity of the land base provides for all our needs; and that
as active participants in the life of the Church, the Indigenous
peoples will strive for reconciliation with the Anglican Communion
towards the common objective that Indigenous people have the right to
self-determination.</I></P>
<p><BR>
</P>
<p><I>The mission
of Indigenous Ministries is to share the cultural differences in the
Church.  Our task through our various ministries is to share the
vision of a journey of spiritual renewal through prayerful dialogue
in the good news of Jesus Christ.</I></P>
<p><BR>
</P>
<p>Following the
1969 Hendry Report <I>Beyond Traplines </I>commissioned for General
Synod, the Sub-Committee on Native Affairs began.  The Council
(Native Ministries) was established by Act 30 of the 1975 General
Synod (maximum 20 people) and again by Act 23 of the 1980 General
Synod giving Council members the responsibility to carry the concerns
of the people directly to the National Executive Council (Council of
General Synod) and General Synod.  ACIP is currently made up of 20
Aboriginal, Inuit and Metis, clergy and lay, men and women from
fifteen dioceses within the Anglican Church of Canada where thirteen
members come from eleven dioceses represented in the Council of the
North.  
</P>
<p><BR>
</P>
<p>1n 1995, The
Anglican Church of Canada accepted and affirmed the <B>Covenant
</B>adopted by the Council (1994) pledging, <I>&quot;Under the
guidance of God's spirit we agree to do all we can to call our people
into unity in a new self-determining community within The Anglican
Church of Canada.  To this end, we extend the hand of partnership to
all those who will help us build a truly Anglican Indigenous Church
in Canada.  May God bless this new vision and give us grace to
accomplish it.&quot;</I></P>

<p><STRONG>II.  CURRENT WORK of ACIP</STRONG></p>
<p><BR>
</P>
<p>The work of ACIP
within the <B><I>Priorities of the 1995 Strategic Plan</I></B> has
been diverse and varied. This report highlights our work as a partner
in the worldwide Anglican Communion and in the universal church, as
we have proclaimed and celebrated the gospel of Jesus Christ in

ministries and ACIP members have participated in many synods and
consultations providing education and dialogue about the ministry in
the Aboriginal communities, the legacy of residential schools, the

national gatherings call us, in partnership, to provide a forum for
Aboriginal, Metis and Inuit people of The Anglican Church of Canada
to reflect on the Church's ministry and to do some visioning about
the future in light of current developments, and to provide a vehicle
to empower Indigenous people and to bring their concerns to the
attention of national church leaders.</I></P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: 0in; font-style: normal">The
Sacred Circles have extended opportunities for healing and
reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal partners.  In
the first gathering in '88 the issues of our historical relationship
were identified, one being the legacy of the residential schools.  At
the 1993 gathering, the Apology was made by our Primate, Michael
Peers and again the invitation to journey together in the healing
ministry.  The Covenant vision of 1994, which was affirmed by General
Synod in 1995, signaled opportunities for spiritual renewal as
Aboriginal people work toward self-determination in the church and
strengthening their identity as Indigenous peoples and as Anglicans. 
 The 1997 gathering continued identifying our movements toward
healing and the needs for spiritual renewal in our communities.  
Memories and reflections on the Sacred Circle 2000 can be read on the
website.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: 0in; font-style: normal">The
Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples has seen growth in the
participation of diocesan Indigenous Ministries over the last
triennium.  We now enjoy hearing news about the events happening in
the dioceses.  Ten dioceses now have Diocesan Native Councils or
Ministries (Cariboo, Qu'Appelle, Brandon, Moosonee, Huron, Keewatin,
Calgary, Saskatchewan, Rupert's Land, and Caledonia).  It is with
these councils' participation that members are appointed to the
Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples and collaboration on other
national issues happens.</P>

<p><BR>
</P>
<p><B>Anglican
Indigenous Healing Fund </B>supports education, healing and
reconciliation programs and events related to the legacy of
residential schools.  It was established in 1991, with an Advisory
Group to assist The Anglican Church of Canada in responding to these
issues in an ongoing, sensitive and just manner.  Grants have been
made and the fund is administered by an Advisory Group to encourage
and initiate programs, which help educate and heal.</P>
<p><BR>
</P>
<p>The healing fund
has expanded to the level of $300,000 in 2001!  Along with this
expansion has been the creation of a new position to coordinate the
fund, which includes diocesan healing initiatives to encourage our
healing journey together. On The Anglican Church of Canada's website
you can read about the projects funded.  In summary we have assisted
some dioceses and many Indigenous communities and organizations
across Canada over the past ten years:</P>

<P><I>&quot;The Anglican Church

partnership which focuses on the cultural, spiritual, social, and
economic independence of Indigenous communities.  To give expression
to this new relationship The Anglican Church of Canada will work
primarily with the Indigenous peoples for a truly Anglican Indigenous
Church in Canada.  It is an important step in the overall quest for
