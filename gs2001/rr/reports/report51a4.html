</P>
<H2 STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in">I.	MANDATE</H2>
<P>The Anglican Consultative Council, at its second meeting held in
Dublin in 1973, adopted the principles of Partners in Mission so that
Anglican churches could consult and share in God's mission within the
larger communion.  The following statement was adopted:</P>
<DL>
	<DD>
	<TABLE WIDTH=400 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>
		<TR>
			<TD VALIGN=TOP>
				<P><I>The responsibility for mission in any place belongs
				primarily to the church in that place.  However, the universality
				of the gospel and the oneness of God's mission mean also that
				this mission must be shared in each and every place with fellow
				Christians from each and every part of the world with their
				distinctive insights and contributions.</I></P>
				<P><I>If once we acted as though there were only givers who had
				nothing to receive and receivers who had nothing to give, the
				oneness of the missionary task must now make us all both givers
				and receivers.</I></P>
			</TD>
		</TR>
	</TABLE>
</DL>
<P>Since the Dublin meeting, there has developed throughout the
Anglican Communion, a common acceptance of what the Church's mission
is as part of the mission of God.  This five-fold definition of
mission, accepted by the Anglican Consultative Council in 1984,
reaffirmed in 1990, 1993 and again in 1996, is summarized as follows:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>To proclaim the Good News of
	the Kingdom </I>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>To teach, baptize and nurture
	new believers.</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>To respond to human need by
	loving service.</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>To seek to transform unjust
	structures of society.</I></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>To strive to safeguard the
	integrity of creation and sustain and renew the earth.</I></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Sharing this broad sense of mission and
vocation for the Anglican Communion as a whole, the General Synod of
the Anglican Church of Canada in 1995 adopted a Strategic Plan which
chose as Priority A, to &quot;strengthen our mission and development
partnerships outside Canada.&quot;  The Partners in Mission Committee
has worked within this priority, under the following mandate:</P>

	<H2>II. THE IMPACT
	OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS CRISIS</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During this triennium, the
Anglican Church of Canada has been served with staggering numbers of
lawsuits from former students of Indian Residential Schools. This
crisis has affected the whole church and has resulted in much
soul-searching, belt-tightening, and remorse. For the Partners in
Mission Committee, the crisis was seen as a time to examine the
legacy of our historical mission practices. Much reflection has
occurred and will continue. In addition, the costs of litigation
during 1999 and 2000 meant that the budget and staffing for the work
of PIM had to be reduced. This has had an impact on our partners,
which we deeply regret. At the same time, our overseas partners have
supported us with love and prayers, and are following our journey
with lively interest. For this solidarity we are indeed grateful.</P>
<p><br></P>
	<H2>III. GENERAL
	POLICY AND OPERATIONS</H2>
<H3>Partners in Mission Committee</H3>
<P>The Committee has 15 members, including 1 ecumenical member and 1
international member.  In this triennium, the ecumenical member has
been the Rev. Bob Faris of the Churches Forum for Global Ministries. 
The international member has been Ms. Judy Berinai, lecturer at the
Sabah Theological Seminary in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. The Committee
normally meets twice a year, in October and February, but the October
meeting in 2000 was cancelled due to budget constraints. In February
of 2000, the Committee travelled to Cuba for its meeting, and also
for an exposure to the work of the Diocese of Cuba. The Committee did
some of its work as a full plenary committee, and at other times
divided into three regional sub-committees (Africa/Middle East,
Asia/Pacific, Latin America/Caribbean) or two functional
sub-committees (Mission Education, Overseas Personnel).  The report
of each of these sub-committees follows.</P>
<H3>Councils</H3>
<P>As part of its mandate, the Committee is responsible for
overseeing our church's relationships with the Canadian Council of
Churches, the Anglican Consultative Council and the World Council of
Churches. 
</P>
<P>During this triennium, the Canadian Council of Churches has worked
at changing itself into a forum, with less time given to legislative
functions and more time given to the member churches learning about
each other. The Council has struggled with financial difficulties
that have limited the size of the staffing complement. In 2000, it
was decided to experiment with an alternative to the usual pattern of
holding a large Trienniel Assembly. Accordingly, the Governing Board
moved its spring meeting to Edmonton and included in its agenda extra
time for interaction with the local Edmonton churches. Our
representatives on the Governing Board during this triennium have
been the Rev. John Steele, Ms. Dorothy Davies-Flindall, the Rev. Jim
Boyles, Dr. Ellie Johnson (alternate). 
</P>
<P>During this triennium, the Anglican Consultative Council held its
eleventh meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland in September of 1999. Our
church's representation on the Anglican Consultative Council has been
the Rt. Rev. Michael Ingham (bishop), the Rev. Barbara Clay (clergy)
and Dr. Stephen Toope (lay). Barbara Clay's term ended at ACC-11, and
the Ven. Sue Moxley who will attend ACC-12 in 2002 has replaced her. 
</P>
<P>The World Council of Churches held its Eighth Assembly in December
of 1998 in Harare, Zimbabwe. Our Church sent 5 official delegates, as
well as a number of visitors and observers. Alice Jean Finlay from
the Diocese of Toronto was elected to the Central Committee where she
will serve until the next General Assembly in 2005 or 2006. 
</P>
<H3>Voluntary Mission Agencies</H3>
<P>There continue to be yearly consultations with Voluntary Mission
Agencies that serve the Anglican Church of Canada, in accordance with
the policy of 1989 governing relations between the General Synod and
these agencies.  These consultations continue to be occasions of
information sharing and dialogue about mission theology and practice.
 In addition to the trust that has been engendered through this
annual meeting there are increasingly opportunities to demonstrate
the interdependence we have in our common mission as Anglicans. 
</P>
<H3>Partners in Mission
Consultation</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The formal Partners in Mission
Consultation process in the Anglican Communion has almost ceased,
mainly because it is seen to be too expensive. However, consultation
continues in smaller, more focused ways. In August of 2000, the
Provincial (General) Secretaries of the Anglican Communion met in
Mississauga, Ontario, hosted by our Church. We requested time to
consult with them concerning our current residential schools crisis
arising from the legacy of past mission practices. The Provincial
Secretaries offered many helpful suggestions from their own contexts.
These suggestions were significant gifts to our church.</P>
<H3>New Ecumenical Justice
Organization, CCJP</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">During 2000, the Canadian
Churches agreed to consolidate and restructure a group of 9
ecumenical justice organizations, most of which dated back to the
1970's. The new ecumenical justice organization, Canadian Churches
for Justice &amp; Peace (CCJP), came into being at the beginning of
2001, and is still struggling through transition and &quot;birthing
pangs&quot;. In terms of the work of PIM, this new organization will
subsume the work of the Inter-Church Committee on Africa (ICCAF), the
Canada Asia Working Group (CAWG) and the Inter-Church Committee on
Human Rights in Latin America (ICCHRLA).</P>
<H3>Staffing Changes</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This past triennium saw
many staffing changes.  Partners in Mission staff are part of the
larger Partnerships Department, which also includes staff supporting
the work of EcoJustice and the Anglican Council of Indigenous
Peoples, under Dr Ellie Johnson as Director. Staffing reductions had
to be made late in 2000, due to a substantial budget shortfall. The
two portfolios that have been cut from Partners in Mission are
Regional Mission Coordinator for Africa, and Coordinator for Mission
Education. We are committed to continuing to work with our partners
in Africa, and will try splitting the work. Dr. Andrea Mann will
relate to the Provinces of the Middle East, Sudan, Southern Africa
and Central Africa, in addition to her continued responsibilities for
our partnerships in Asia and the South Pacific. Ms. Jill Cruse will
relate to the Provinces of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and the Indian
Ocean, in addition to continuing as Coordinator for Volunteers in
Mission. The Rev. Philip Wadham will relate to the Province of West
Africa, in addition to his responsibilities for our partnerships in
Latin America and the Caribbean. Philip will also do the Mission
Education work.  The Rev. Maylanne Maybee, who was formerly doing the
Mission Education work, is now giving all her time to the work of
EcoJustice.</P>

	<H2>IV. AFRICA /
	MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIPS</H2>
<H3>Background</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Our partners in the region include the
following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">12 autonomous ecclesiastical
	Anglican Provinces:</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">Central Africa,
Kenya, Southern Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Congo,
West Africa, Sudan, Indian Ocean, the Church in Jerusalem and the
Middle East.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">5 ecumenical institutions (down
	from 9 in the previous triennium):</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">All Africa
Conference of Churches, World Student Christian Federation, Project
for Christian Muslim Relations in Africa (PROCMURA), Formation
Biblique et Th&eacute;ologique &agrave; Mauritius, Association of
Christian Lay Centres in Africa. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">2 Pan-African Anglican
	institutions:</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	ANITEPAM (African Network of
Institutions of Theological Education Preparing</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	Anglicans for Ministry) and CAPA
(Council of Anglican Provinces of Africa).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The vastness of the change in Africa,
the exploding growth of the church there in the midst of
extraordinary social, political and economic turmoil, the reality of
our present budget cutbacks, all these things require that we examine
carefully what and where are to be our appropriate partnership
linkages for the future.</P>
<H3>Priorities Of Our Partners</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In agreement with most of the partners
that Theological Education is a priority in the region, we have
requested that a portion of our regular block grant to Provinces be
passed on to theological colleges and seminaries in West Africa (St
Nicholas), Tanzania ( St Mark's and St Cyprian's), Kenya ( St Paul's
United Theological College), Seychelles (St. Philip's), Uganda
(Uganda Christian University), Burundi (Institut Th&eacute;ologique
de Matana), Sudan (Bishop Gwynne College) and Congo (ISThA - Bunia). 
Meanwhile we continue to support Theological Education by Extension
(TEE) in Mauritius and the work of ANITEPAM (African Network of
Institutions of Theological Education Preparing Anglicans for
Ministry). 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bursaries have enabled students to
attend seminaries both in Africa and Canada, with graduates from the
latter serving now as bishops and seminary professors.  Since the
last General Synod meeting, we have been able to sponsor 22 students
from the region.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A second priority is conflict
transformation toward lasting peace with justice for all. Partners in
Mission continues to work with regional Anglican and ecumenical
organizations in efforts toward the cessation of war and violence
against persons oppressed by race, ethnicity and religion.</P>
<H3>Support for Anglican
Provinces and Special Projects</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Without any exaggeration we can say
that the Africa / Middle East region is the fastest growing part of
the church in our world-wide Anglican Communion.  There is an ongoing
need to support provinces and new dioceses.  We make regular grants
to provinces for basic infrastructure needs, as well as assisting
with all forms of necessary transport (bicycles, motorcycles,
vehicles) and supporting catechists, evangelists and new bishops
through training programs.</P>
<H3>Ecumenical Partners</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We continue our partnership with the
All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), which is the most
significant Pan-African ecumenical body.  Half of our annual grant to
AACC goes to the International Affairs Desk, which is playing a very
important role in the peace and reconciliation process across the
continent.  We continue to be partners with the Association of
Christian Lay Centres in Africa (ACLA).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Africa is a multi-faith continent
(African Traditional Religion, Islam and Christianity).  The growth
of Islam in Africa and the Middle East, as globally, continues to be
an important focus of study and dialogue for Anglicans. For this
reason we value our partnership with PROCMURA (Project for Christian
Muslim Relations in Africa) in its training and teaching roles.
During 2000, a former Director of PROCMURA, Dr. Stuart Brown, joined
our staff on a short-term contract to serve as Regional Mission
Coordinator for Africa and the Middle East. Unfortunately, the budget
shortfall meant that his contract could not be extended.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Canada, we have
continued to do our Africa justice work ecumenically, through our
participation in the new ecumenical justice organization, Canadian
Churches for Justice &amp; Peace (CCJP), under which the former
Inter-Church Committee on Africa (ICCAF) was subsumed at the
beginning of 2001</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<H3>Partnership</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Companion Diocese
relationship between Brandon and Southwest Tanganyika (Tanzania) was
formally concluded in October 2000 after a span of 8 years. Rupert's
Land and Central Buganda (Uganda) continue their companionship, which
will be reviewed at the end of 2001. Ontario and Kumasi (Ghana) have
been in companionship since 1994.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We have been very moved by
the messages of solidarity coming to us from our partners in Africa,
who stand in support of our work of healing and reconciliation with
Canada's Indigenous Peoples, to which we have committed ourselves for
the foreseeable future. This new commitment will happen at the
expense of commitments to African partners, among others. It has been
very painful to have to write to our partners the news of the loss of
our staff person dedicated to Africa, as well as a reduction of
approximately 25% in our financial support to African partners. This
news has been received with amazing graciousness. We continue to
learn more about the depths of partnership and feel blessed by the
strength of our friendships.</P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 2001, Partners in Mission has
budgeted $300,000 for support of the mission work of our partner
churches in the Africa / Middle East Region, down by 26% from the
previous year.</P>

	<H2>V. ASIA/PACIFIC
	PARTNERSHIPS</H2>
<H3>Background</H3>
<P>The priority of the Asia/Pacific work of Partners in Mission
continues to be the building of mutual partnerships for mission and
justice-seeking between the Anglican Church of Canada and our
regional Anglican and ecumenical church partners. Anglican partners
over the past triennium include the Episcopal Church of the
Philippines, Philippine Independent Church, Anglican Church of Korea,
Province of South East Asia, Nippon Sei Ko Kai (Holy Catholic Church
of Japan), Province of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, Church of the
Province of Myanmar, the two dioceses of the Church of Ceylon (Sri
Lanka), and the Provinces and dioceses of the South Pacific Anglican
Council, namely the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea, Church of
the Province of Melanesia and Diocese of Polynesia.  Post
denominational and ecumenical partners include the Church of North
India, China Christian Council, Christian Conference of Asia, Pacific
Conference of Churches, the ecumenical councils of churches in Korea,
Japan, the Philippines, Myanmar/Burma, India and Sri Lanka, and other
Asian and Pacific ecumenical organizations and institutions. Budget
and staffing reductions toward the end of the triennium meant a
withdrawal of financial and administrative resources from long
standing relationships with most national ecumenical organizations,
and a decrease in same for Provincial partnerships. Beginning in
2001, funding was withdrawn from 9 historical partnerships.</P>
<H3>Priorities of Our Partners</H3>
<P>Through visits, correspondence and consultations, our Asia/South
Pacific partners continued to identify the priorities of theological
education and leadership development, evangelism, and infrastructure
development. As many partners live in situations of civil war and
communal violence, conflict transformation, reconciliation and peace
with justice also emerged as priorities. These four priority areas
will guide the development of Asia/South Pacific partnerships in the
triennium ahead.  
</P>
<H3>Theological Education and
Leadership Development</H3>
<P>We have assisted in the development of leadership in the region
through scholarships for graduate theological education and workshops
for the training of personnel from the Philippines, India,
Myanmar/Burma, Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.
While most support is directed for regional training and education, a
number of Asians and South Pacific Islanders came to Canada for
studies.  Close partnership with students' home Provinces, and with
Canadian dioceses and theological colleges made these programs of
study possible. Regretably, due to the rising costs of graduate
education in Canada for foreign students, and to budget reductions,
no similar programs are planned for the next triennium. Two important
foci in regional educational workshops were developing women's skills
for bible study and theology, and 'reading the Bible through new
[diverse, Asian] eyes'. 
</P>
<P>Theological colleges receiving support for capital works, library
acquisitions and faculty stipends, etc. included St. Andrew's
Seminary, Manila, the two regional seminaries of the Philippine
Independent Church, Aglipay Central Theological Seminary and St.
Paul's Regional Seminary; Bishop's College, Calcutta; South Asia
Theological Research Institute, Bangalore, Ditt Memorial Research
Centre, Amritsar, Christian Institute for Research Studies, Batala,
the Henry Martyn Insitute: International Centre for Research,
Interfaith Relations and Reconciliation, Hyderabad, Holy Cross
Theological College, Rangoon; Newton Theological College, Popondetta;
Bishop Patteson Theological College, Honiara, and Pacific Theological
College, Suva.  
</P>
<P>We have also continued to support regional associations of
theological education in the South Pacific and South East Asia.  
</P>
<H3>Evangelism</H3>
<P>Partners in Mission policy in the Asia/Pacific region continues to
affirm the principle that evangelism in Asia/Pacific is primarily the
mission of the local church. Our regional Anglican and ecumenical
partners are engaged in a variety of initiatives<B>, </B>such as
social services, lay evangelism and church renewal. We have supported
various missions, including the development of a joint Melanesian
Brothers and Philippines Independent Church community centre in
Palawan, the building of a permanent residence for Melanesian Sisters
in Malaita, and stipend support for rural women lay leaders in
Kurunegala.</P>
<H3>Conflict Transformation,
Reconciliation and Peace with Justice</H3>
<P>Justice and human rights concerns continued to be significant
throughout the regions.  Many Asian and South Pacific partners
experience and/or work with marginalized peoples facing poverty,
denial of basic human rights, armed conflict and other forms of
violence, ethnic, gender and religious intolerance, and frequent
natural disasters. The situations of conflict in Burma, Sri Lanka and
the Philippines remain especially acute, while violent civil strife
has more recently surfaced in India, the Solomon Islands and Fiji.</P>
<P>We have supported the Episcopal Church of the Philippines in their
outreach ministries among Filipino migrant labourers and indigenous
peoples, the human rights desk of the National Council of Churches in
Sri Lanka, and violent trauma analysis workshops led by the World
Student Christian Federation (Asia/Pacific) in Hong Kong.  We have
written letters of solidarity to partners in the Philippines, Fiji,
Solomon Islands, and Sri Lanka struggling for restoration of peace
with justice in those countries. 
</P>
<P>We have continued to support the peace and reconciliation ministry
of the Diocese of Colombo, Sri Lanka, and have entered into a new
partnership with the Henry Martyn Institute: International Centre for
Research, Interfaith Relations and Reconciliation, Hyderabad, India.</P>
<P>Regional social justice work has continued ecumenically through
the Canada Asia Working Group (CAWG). Through CAWG, we have been
involved in justice concerns in countries where we do not have
Anglican partners, such as Indonesia and East Timor.  CAWG is now
joining the new ecumenical justice organization, Canadian Churches
for Justice &amp; Peace (CCJP), which will mean significant
administrative changes, and some program changes in 2001. We have
continued to work with the Pacific Peoples' Partnership in their
advocacy for justice in issues relating to the impact of trade
globalization on culture, climate, traditional economies and
occupations, and the environment in the South Pacific.</P>
<H3>Partnership</H3>
<P>Mission is about people and developing mutual, respectful,
responsible relationships.  In the last three years, there have been
many visits back and forth between the Anglican Church of Canada and
Anglican churches and ecumenical organizations in Asia and the South
Pacific.  The national Partners in Mission Committee has been richly
blessed this triennium by the active participation of Ms. Judy
Berinai, from Malaysia. Judy is a member of the faculty of the Sabah
Theological Seminary, Kota Kinabalu, Diocese of Sabah, Province of
South East Asia.</P>
<P>Diocesan companion relationships between the Dioceses of Nova
Scotia and Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea), and the Dioceses of
Calgary and Temotu (Melanesia) have ended.  Companionships continuing
into the next triennium include the Dioceses of Qu'Appelle, West
Malaysia and Lichfield, the Diocese of British Columbia and the
Church of the Province of Myanmar, and the Diocese of New Westminster
and the Episcopal Church of Taiwan.  The Diocese of Eastern
Newfoundland and Labrador also continues its ecumenical companionship
with the United Church of Canada, the Presbyterian Church in Canada
and the Diocese of Jabalpur, Church of North India.</P>
<P>Ecumenical relationship with the China Christian Council has been
renewed.  We are exploring with Canadian and Chinese church partners
how best to work together in encouraging people exchanges and
cross-cultural theological education, and in understanding religious
freedom in China. In response to a request by General Synod 1998 for
the <I>&quot;PIMC to consult with the China Christian Council to
determine the most appropriate means to influence the government of
China to take steps to alleviate the often tragic results of their
One Child Policy&quot;, </I>three<I> </I>recommendations were made to
the Council of General Synod (COGS/May 2000) as follows:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>That the One Child Policy is widely accepted among China's
	population;</P>
	<LI><P>That COGS encourage Canadians to join in the international
	encouragement of China's efforts to address its population growth
	and resultant social issues;</P>
	<LI><P>That COGS suggest to the Canadian Government that any offer
	of Canadian intervention toward alleviating the People's Republic of
	China's negative results of the One Child Policy might include:</P>
</OL>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Bilateral discussion between Canadian and Chinese government
	officials, social planning scholars and practitioners on poverty and
	gender issues in China's and Canada's ongoing family planning and
	social development programmes;</P>
	<LI><P>Bilateral and multilateral discussion between Chinese and
	other nations' governments and groups, especially Indian, where
	family planning is also intended to slow population growth, ease
	poverty and improve the long term quality of life for people. (India
	is also a country where female foeticide, infanticide and
	abandonment are practiced as means to a second, preferably male,
	child.)

</P>
<P>As we approach the beginning of a new triennium, the Anglican
Church of Canada's relationships with Anglican churches and
ecumenical organizations in the Asia/Pacific are alive and well,
despite reductions in our operating budget and staffing energies. In
partnership over the past triennium, we have grown in our
understanding of mission toward peace, justice and the integrity of
creation. We are deeply thankful for and look forward to partners'
continuing companionship on this journey of faith and witness,
especially as we say farewell to some and learn how less is more with
those remaining.</P>

	<H2>VI. LATIN
	AMERICA/CARIBBEAN (LAC)</H2>
<H3>Background</H3>
<P>The region is vast and diverse: about 35 independent states and a
handful of dependent colonial territories with countries ranging in
size from small Caribbean islands to the vastness of Brazil.   The
Anglican/Episcopal presence consists of some long established
Provinces (Brazil, Cono Sur and the West Indies) as well as the new
autonomous Provinces of Mexico (1995) and Central Region of the
Americas (January 1998).  Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Bermuda
continue to be extra-Provincial dioceses.  Of these four Cuba and
Puerto Rico are in continuing discussion with the dioceses of the
Dominican Republic and Haiti in the formation of a new 'Province of
the Caribbean'. Our key ecumenical partnerships are with the CLAI
(Latin American Council of Churches), the CCC (Caribbean Conference
of Churches), the CONIC (National Council of Churches of Brazil), and
the CEC (Cuban Ecumenical Council).</P>
<H3>Priorities For The Region</H3>
<P>Our partnership is developed through consultation with the
dioceses/provinces in the region and there are some common priorities
that have been identified.  These are<B>:</B></P>
<UL>
	<LI><H3>Education for Clergy and
	Lay People</H3>
</UL>
<P>This is the number one priority throughout the region.  With
respect to clerical leadership there exists in the region a variety
of training programs to prepare and equip people, both men and women
for the diaconate and the priesthood.  As well as the traditional
patterns of training in seminaries such as Codrington College,
Barbados and in Jamaica at the United Theological College of the West
Indies other programs throughout the region offer both full and
part-time theological education.  The Ecumenical Seminary in
Matanzas, Cuba is presently over enrolled, a sign of a growing
interest in the Church in that country.  
</P>
<P>Continuing education for clergy is also emphasized in the region
and a particularly good example of this is to be found in El Salvador
where a provincial program offers weeklong residential courses to its
clergy.   There continues to be a shortage of Anglican priests in LAC
and there is a strong commitment throughout the Anglican Church in
LAC to train lay people for pastoral and theological leadership.  A
good example of this is to be found in the Windward Islands where the
newly opened pastoral centre serves as the base for their lay
training-for-ministry program.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><H3>Evangelism and
	Missionary Expansion</H3>
</UL>
<P>The balance of a strong commitment to social involvement,
particularly among marginalized people, a sound liturgical practice
and a rational approach towards scripture sees the Anglican Church in
the region continuing to grow steadily if not spectacularly.  The
growth of the church is greatest where the local context has been
allowed to modify existing worship patterns.  In Cuba, where music
and dance are a vital expressions of the peoples identity the best of
their worship contains both these elements.  In Jamaica, at Congress
2000 (see below) drums powerfully animated the opening eucharist. 
Along with its social commitment modified but identifiably Anglican
worship is one of the tools of evangelism.</P>
<P>Missionary work continues under the direction and participation of
national clergy and lay people.  In Brazil, at their Provincial Synod
(see below) there was much celebration at the inauguration of two new
missionary districts, a decision that follows a number of years of
planning.  The region continues to be aggressively targetted by
fundamentalist groups, the majority of these being national and many
'one off' expressions of the gospel.    
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><H3>Justice Making</H3>
</UL>
<P>In addition to diocesan and parish program of social concern the
Anglican /Episcopal Church in LAC, in varying degrees promotes the
biblical mandate for 'doing justice'.  In Brazil this is particularly
evident in accompaniment work with the Landless Movement and
indigenous peoples.  In Northern Argentina aboriginal people involved
in land claims have strong Anglican and ecumenical backing.  In
Guatemala Mayan people are encouraged by church support both for
their justice struggles and for a genuinely Mayan expression of their
spirituality.  A Mayan woman was the first female priest ordained in
the diocese of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>Although the gap between the rich and the poor in LAC has always
been large the past three years has seen it expand further.  The
answer to this widening divide between the haves and the have nots
requires more than charity and national organizations that represent
the poor continue to work hard, often at great personal risk, to
bring about structural changes.  The Anglican/Episcopal Church in LAC
continues to stand alongside those who work for a more equitable
sharing of resources.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><H3>Infrastructure/Material
	Resources</H3>
</UL>
<P>As 'compa&ntilde;eros' (companions) of our brothers and sisters in
LAC the Anglican Church of Canada, through its Partnership program
transfers funds to the Anglican/Episcopal Church in the region.   The
majority of this funding is through block grants to the provinces. 
In the case of two extra-provincial dioceses (Cuba and Venezuela)
direct payment is made to their synod office.  Decisions with respect
to the use of these funds are made by the provinces/dioceses and
these are in line with our partners priorities.  As we have struggled
in the current year with a decrease in the funds we have available to
share with LAC we have been very encouraged by words of understanding
and solidarity received from our 'compa&ntilde;eros' in the region. 
</P>
<H3>Events, Anglican and
Otherwise, of Note in the Region</H3>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1999 open air services in the
	major cities in Cuba organised by the Cuban Council of Churches to
	celebrate the various denominational/evangelical expressions of our
	faith.  These were attended by tens of thousands of Cubans and
	President Castro was present at opening celebrations.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Brazil the formation of two new
	'Missionary Districts' in which the Episcopal Anglican Church will
	initiate new work, both liturgical and social.  The formation of
	these districts is a direct response to local invitations.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Jamaica 'Congress 2000', a
	provincial gathering, the first in the history of the Province of
	the West Indies.  Around 300 Anglicans met together to look at
	present realities for the church and began the process of planning
	for the future.  Of particular significance were the presence and
	the strong voice of young people at this assembly.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The continuation of the
	'nationalization' of the Anglican Church in the region, with Church
	leadership and congregational participation increasingly in the
	hands of nationals.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New Companion Diocesan
	relationships begun between the dioceses of Cuba and Niagara, Guyana
	and Saskatoon, and Northern Mexico and Kootenay.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Final Reflections</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With the Anglican Church in Latin
America continuing its journey of faith, it is encouraging to note
the changes that are taking place.  Seeking to express an Anglican
ethos within a Latin context poses some particular problems but where
this challenge has been grasped the church is healthy.   Young people
form a large part of the church (as they do throughout the continent)
and the ownership they express of <I>their</I> church is wonderful.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the Caribbean the historical
formation of the province by the Church of England is still very
evident.  Again, it is among the young people that some of the
liturgical expressions resulting from these links are being
challenged.  At 'Congress 2000' many delegates expressed concern for
the falling number of young people involved in the church and the
need to 'do something'.  In fact the young people there were also
clear that their voice needed to be listened to if they were to
remain involved in the Anglican Church.  It is to the credit of the
present leadership in the province that this concern is being taken
seriously.  &quot;If we don't,&quot; said one delegate, &quot; we may
end up like the Anglican Church in Canada&quot;.   
</P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 2001 Partners in
Mission has budgeted $230,000 for support of the mission work of our
partner churches in the Latin America/Caribbean Region, down 23% from
the previous year.</P>

	<H2>VII. THE
	VOLUNTEERS IN MISSION PROGRAM AND THE THEOLOGICAL
	STUDENTS'INTERNATIONAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Volunteers In Mission</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Volunteers In Mission
Program of the Anglican Church of Canada was approved at the Winnipeg
General Synod in 1986. The first appointments were made in late 1988
and early 1989 to Fiji and Tanzania. Since that time 77 adults and 12
children have served as Volunteers In Mission in 26 countries and
returned to Canada. Volunteers have come from 19 of our 30 dioceses,
from BC to Nova Scotia. The year 2000 has seen 13 volunteers return
to Canada after completing their placements.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the time of writing,
there are 7 volunteers serving with partner churches or institutions:
 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Paul Jeffries from

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The joint program with the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada continued until 1993 at which
time the ELCIC decided to move it's program operation to their
national headquarters in Winnipeg. Both programs continue to consult
and learn from one another.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Volunteers are required to
form a support group in their local area whose functions are to
provide moral and spiritual support and to raise the funds needed to
cover the costs of such things as return airfare, health insurance
and a modest monthly living allowance. Experience has shown this is
quite possible and allows qualified volunteers to serve with minimal
cost to the General Synod budget.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Volunteers are also
required to participate in a cross-cultural Orientation Conference
designed and delivered by the Canadian Churches Forum for Global
Ministries. This is a well-planned event, ecumenical for both
participants and presenters, and gives a solid grounding for the
volunteers to draw on during their placement overseas. Returned
volunteers participate in a Re-Entry to Canada Conference which is
designed to assist them to integrate and use their experience in
their continuing ministry at home.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We participate in the
Forum for Global Ministries through an annual grant and by membership
on the Board and the curriculum committee of the Forum.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The VIM program is a
vehicle for mission education within the church here in Canada.
Parishes and dioceses are closely connected to the volunteers and
their learnings and experiences. Parish-based support groups
circulate letters and newsletters, sent home by the volunteers,
within the parish and to diocesan groups. Some dioceses include
letters from the volunteers in their diocesan paper. Volunteers
return home greatly enriched and committed to sharing what their
experiences have taught them. Their support group assists them, as
needed, in arranging opportunities within their diocese to do so.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The PIMC initiated a
Program Evaluation of Volunteers in Mission in 1997, when the program
was 10 years old. The purpose of the review was: &quot;to assess the
effectiveness of the Volunteers In Mission Program against the goals
of the program and our church's wider goals of partnership and
mission.&quot; The first draft of the report was received by PIMC in
March 1998 with a final report and recommendations ready for the fall
1998 meeting of the Council of General Synod. Such issues as
appropriate recognition of volunteers, using the VIM program for
receiving missioners from our partner churches and developing
in-Canada placements for VIM were reviewed by the evaluator,
resulting in 12 recommendations to the PIMC.  These recommendations
have been largely implemented over this past triennium, while the
committee has continued to work on the recommendation to use the VIM
model for receiving missioners to Canada.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Goals for the next
triennium are to implement the remaining recommendations of the VIM
evaluation, where possible, and to maintain a participant level that
ensures the quality of the program placements.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H3>Overseas Summer Student
Internship Program 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The goals of the program
are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To increase awareness
	of global concerns among theological students.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To increase students'
	commitment to our church's mission and ministry.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">To give prospective
	clergy and professional lay workers who have not lived in a
	developing country an experience of the third world.</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This program was piloted
in 1992 with the placement of one student in Belize. This pilot
placement received a very positive evaluation and Partners in Mission
Committee has continued the program.  The theological students, their
bishops and their hosts all evaluate the program highly.  26 students
have participated in summer international internships since the
program began. In 1999, 3 students were placed in St. Vincent, Guinea
Conakry and Zimbabwe.  In 2000, 2 students served in the Belize and
Uganda and in 2001 there will be two students serving in Trinidad and
Tobago.</P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The budget for the VIM
program and the Overseas Student Internship Program was not reduced.
The 2001 budget for the VIM program is $40,000, while that for the
Overseas Student Internship Program is $18,500. Funds to support
individual volunteers are raised in parishes and dioceses across
Canada, and totaled almost $200,000 in 1999.

	<H2>VIII. MISSION
	EDUCATION, INTERPRETATION, AND RESOURCES</H2>
<H3>Companion Diocese Program</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A goal set by the bishops
meeting in Lambeth in 1998 was to have every diocese in the communion
in companionship with another diocese.  The Anglican Church of Canada
is still a little short of that goal - of our 30 dioceses, 22 are in
some form of companionship.  Since the last General Synod in 1998,
six Canadian dioceses concluded their companionships, six struck new
companionships, and several others renewed or extended ones that were
already current.  Of these companionships, seven are in Latin America
or the Caribbean, five in Asia or the South Pacific, three in Africa,
four in Canada, and three are elsewhere - the United Kingdom and
Australia.  The role of Partnerships continues to be encouraging
dioceses to enter into companionships, enabling the flow of
information and sharing of resources, being a &quot;matchmaker&quot;
for the companion diocese program in Canada and the wider communion,
and offering advice and expertise through our regional mission staff.</P>
<H3>Jubilee: Releasing the Vision</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A primary educational focus for
Anglicans and their ecumenical partners during the past triennium was
Jubilee  -- not only the <I>Jubilee 2000 </I>campaign to cancel the
debt of the world's most impoverished countries, but also the
biblical tradition and its theological meaning in our time in terms
of globalization, the use and distribution of wealth, and the
relationship between peoples and the earth.   Partners in Mission
combined financial and staffing resources from EcoJustice and PWRDF
to sponsor the most successful &quot;Making the Connections&quot;
conference held to date.  In August 1999, more than 100 people from
27 dioceses gathered in Peterborough to learn about and celebrate the
Jubilee theme.  The conference helped to shape a highly functional
network for learning and leadership in the years following.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Partners in Mission participated,
through a representative, in the Joint Working Group on Jubilee. The
Joint Working Group was established by the Council of General Synod
to act as a liaison between and among committees and dioceses of the
national church, and as a reference group to staff who related to the
Jubilee Theme.</P>
<H3>People Exchange and
Partnership Visits 
</H3>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">These two programs provide financial
support and advice for visits and exchanges between companion
dioceses and other partners.  The People Exchange fund assists
international visitors to come to Canada for companionship visits,
conferences, or other special events.  It helped to bring visitors
from Northern Mexico, Brazil, Myanmar, Northern India, Kenya, and
other parts of the world to Canada.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Partnership Visits fund provides
small grants to dioceses and parishes in Canada for sending
individuals or groups overseas, also for companionship visits,
conferences, or other special events.  From 1998 to 2000, grants were
disbursed to individuals, delegations, youth groups and students to
visit companion dioceses and partners in Africa and the Middle East,
Asia and the South Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well
as the United Kingdom, and to visit communities in Iqaluit and the
Nass Valley within Canada.</P>
<H3>Global Mission Network</H3>
<P>As new ways of working are being imagined and developed, an Asia
Pacific Mission Network among Canadian Anglicans was initiated from
the Asia Pacific desk, and is now being expanded into a Partners in
Mission Network with a global focus.  Its purpose is to foster
information sharing and strengthen relationships between global
partners and Canadian Anglicans at the diocesan and parish levels. 
The Network will connect people who have shown interest in the
mission work of the Anglican Church of Canada.  Participants will
receive resource materials and an updated mailing list twice a year. 
Response to this proposal has been positive, and plans are proceeding
to make it happen.</P>
<H3>Educational Resources</H3>
<P>A &quot;Newsy Letter about Mission Education&quot; has been
produced and distributed occasionally to Mission Education contact
people in each diocese.  A Mission Education Resource Binder was also
produced and distributed in each diocese, in a format that will make
it easy to update and supplement.  In 1999, the first edition of
Praying with our Partners: A Canadian Supplement to the Anglican
Cycle of Prayer was printed and mailed to every parish in Canada. 
The supplement highlights ways in which the Anglican Church of Canada
expresses its partnership with different provinces and dioceses of
the Anglican Communion and features as they are prayed for Sunday by
Sunday in the Anglican Cycle of Prayer.  Reception of this resource,
now in its third year, has been very positive, and plans are being
made to integrate other forms of partnership - with indigenous
peoples and with EcoJustice partners - into the cycle in future
editions.  
</P>
<H3>Staff Changes</H3>
<P>Reduced staffing following the cuts made in August 2000 mean that
coordination of Mission Education formerly combined with Justice
Education, will shift to the Rev. Philip Wadham.</P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
<P>In 2001, Partners in Mission has budgeted $54,500 for Mission
Education programs, a reduction of 24% from the previous year.</P>

	<H2>IX. FUTURE
	DIRECTIONS</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Residential Schools crisis has had
a profound effect on the Anglican Church of Canada. For the Partners
in Mission Committee, this crisis has led to sober reflection on the
damaging consequences of our past mission philosophy and practice. At
the end of the last triennium in 1998, the PIMC remarked on the slow
progress towards true mutuality and equal partnership, and
recommended that substantial attention be directed in the future
towards the problem of dependency in mission relationships. Now, at
the end of the present triennium, we are suddenly keenly aware of the
lingering vestiges of colonialism in Canada that continue to poison
the relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous Canadians.
Our analysis of the lack of equality and mutuality in our
international mission relationships has been sharpened by our current
reflections on the historical/colonial roots of present-day broken
relationships in Canada. As we look ahead, we see the main mission
work of our church to be dealing with the legacy of our past mission
practices among indigenous peoples in Canada. But we also recognize
the importance of maintaining our relationships with the rest of the
Anglican Communion. Much support and advice has already been offered
to us by our overseas partners, and hopefully, will continue to be
offered. For our part, as we journey through this difficult period in
our history, we will try to integrate the advice being offered to us,
and to share our experiences and our learnings with our overseas
partners. While the work of healing and reconciliation will demand
much of our time, energy and resources, we hope that the members of
the next PIMC will do their best to continue to support our partners
financially and to maintain our international partnerships.</P>
