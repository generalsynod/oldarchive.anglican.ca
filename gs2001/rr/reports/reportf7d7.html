<p class="resSubj">In Service of Communion: the Interim Report of The General Synod Task Force on Jurisdiction to The Council of General Synod and The Canadian House of Bishops</p>



<STRONG>7 March, 2001</STRONG>
<P>The origin of
"Jurisdiction" as a feature of the life of the church reach
back into the early days of the post-resurrection community in
Jerusalem.  Jurisdiction of some form is nascently present in the
"twelve" who were chosen by Jesus, and who, in the
aftermath of the ascension, chose Matthias to make up their number
and to take the place of Judas Iscariot.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
It is certainly there in the creation of the ministry of deacons,<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>
 and in the validation of Saul's conversion and calling to
preach the gospel to the gentiles.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Saul's
ministry provoked one of the most memorable of the early church's
manifestations of apostolic authority issuing in the exercise of
jurisdiction in the interests of the growth and nurture of the
church.  Confronted with the issue of who might be included with the
"ecclesia" in the wake of the wholesale conversion of
uncircumcised gentiles in Asia minor, the early church met (c.49 CE)
for what is now referred to as the Council of Jerusalem. The issues
invoked here were aggravated by centuries of ill-will and prejudice. 
Gentiles were, by definition of Jewish prejudice, unclean, idolatrous
and given to unspeakable acts of immorality.  The early Christians ,
all of whom were Jewish, quite simply could not conceive of how such
people might be included in the church as full members unless they
repudiated their race and culture, submitting to circumcision as the
sign of the sincerity of their repentance and inclusion into the
covenant of the law as delivered by Moses. The "Judgement of
James"<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>
represents, in the truest sense, the exercise of jurisdiction in the
interests of the "communion" of the whole church.  It was,
in effect a compromise. The Jewish Christians had some of their worst
fears about the allegedly unclean lifestyle of gentiles put to rest,
while the gentiles were recognized as full members of the church
without the prohibitive requirement of circumcision.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>That is what
"jurisdiction" is all about, the careful and caring
exercise of authority to guide and enable the growth and lively faith
of the church.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>This exercise
of authority has its roots in the early church's memory of the
promise Jesus gave to His disciples in the "Farewell Discourses"
of the gospel according to St. John.  There, in response to the
disciples' dismay at his immanent departure from their midst,
the Christ promises that the Father will send the "Paraclete"
(lit: the enabler) "who will lead you into all truth."<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>
 All exercise of authority as jurisdiction within the church proceeds
from the church's confidence in the truth of this promise.  This
does not mean that the church is inerrant or infallible.  It can,
has, does, and will in the future make mistakes.  But the efficacy of
the paracletic guidance of God's Church is such that it cannot
be in error indefinitely or irretrievably.  The Spirit always guides,
always corrects, always brings the Church (sometimes slowly and
painfully) "into all truth".  We either believe in the
truth of this promise or should shut up shop tomorrow!</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The long view
of Church history provides a rich parade of examples of how the
Spirit of God has renewed, and redirected, through the ministry of
authority exercised as jurisdiction, the practice and doctrinal
teaching of the Church.  One such example is in the matter of
slavery.  It is obvious from the evidence of Acts and the letters of
St. Paul that the early Christians, while affirming that all baptized
persons were "new creations" in God's grace, and
brothers and sisters in Christ, nevertheless accepted without protest
or comment, the brutal institution of slavery.  With rare exceptions,
this continued to be the case until the early 1800's, when the
convicted witness of William Wilberforce and his colleagues brought
about the abolition of slavery in the British Empire.  Wilberforce
acted out of Christian conviction, but was violently opposed by many
of his fellow-believers, who argued in support of slavery, citing
precedents from scripture. The slavery  example is, in some senses,
extra-ecclesial, but stands nevertheless as an example of how the
Spirit can and does "guide" us into "all truth". 
In point of fact, however, the established nature of the Church of
England sets the Parliament of England as the highest court of the
church in that province, so that the passage of the bill abolishing
slavery in the British Empire in 1833 may be seen as an action of the
Church of England in its role as a integral part of the two houses of
Parliament.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>More recent
examples, within the Anglican Church of Canada, might include the
amendment of the Marriage Canon to permit the remarriage of divorced
persons and the action of General Synod to permit the ordination of
women to the priesthood and to the Episcopate.  In both cases,
long-entrenched traditional practices and/or doctrinal teachings of
the Church were challenged and found wanting, and the exercise of
authority as jurisdiction enabled a renewal of the Church in its
pastoral and sacramental life.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>None of this
happened without debate, argument and disagreement.  The Church is
not, nor has it ever been a "perfect" institution inhabited
by a "perfect" people.  The Church as the "bride of
Christ,... without spot or wrinkle"<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A></SUP>
exists only as an eschatological promise &#150; a vision of what we
will become in the fullness of God's grace!</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>What we are now
is a company of people whom Jesus has called together into communion,
with the intention that the life which we share might nurture us in
our journey of faith, and might by example and witness, call others
to do so as well.  It is in this context, through the tradition of
two millennia of grace, that the exercise of authority as
jurisdiction can be seen to be the servant of the greater good of
communion.</P>
<P><U><B>COMMUNION
AND AUTHORITY</B></U></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Our shared
communion is one of God's greatest gifts to the Church.  This is
both literally and figuratively true.  The Holy Eucharist stands at
the heart of our collective experience as Christians.  It is the
symbol of our life together, and serves as the touchstone for our
wider sense of communion.  The Eucharist draws us all together,
including those who would otherwise be separated by political belief,
social status, economic class, cultural difference, ethnicity, or
sexual orientation, to name but a few of our human distinctions.
Archbishop Michael Peers has recently suggested that our primary
obligation as Christians is to be in communion, and that this
obligation requires that our commitment to doctrinal orthodoxy be
tempered by an acknowledgment of human fallibility in comprehending
the mind of God.  In the Primate's words, there is "no
absolute other than God".<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A></SUP>
Historic Anglicanism has always valued communion over certainty. This
was so even in the less-than-charitable times of the late 16<SUP>th</SUP>
century. When hard-line Calvinists within the church of England
pressed her to authorize the enforcement of a detailed confessional
statement, after the style of Genevan Protestantism, the Queen,
acting as supreme governor of the Church of England, told them that
"we do not build windows into men's minds." Four and a
half centuries later, the Virginia Report<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A></SUP>
suggests that communion aims "to free the people of God to use
their God&#150;given gifts responsibly and cooperatively, in every
way compatible with the gospel and its effective proclamation in word
and deed".  Communion, then, is about freeing us and enabling us
to be the best that we can be. Communion equips us to rise to God's
challenge.  It allows the Church to be "the effectual sign of
the supernatural in the midst of the natural order", to adopt
Michael Ramsey's explanation.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>This
understanding of the centrality of communion to the life of the
Church carries rich implications for our approach to the concept of
authority. "Authority" is a complex term.  It can be
understood in a number of ways.  One speaks of authority to do or to
compel something.  Here "authority" is used synonymously
with "power", and can imply  dominance.  "Authority"
can also be a noun: one is an authority on a given subject.  Here
"authority" relates to learning or to expertise. 
"Authority" may also be used to describe a person or body
whose ideas or decisions are "authoritative".  This use of
the word implies that the authority is persuasive or, to put it
another way. that the pronouncements are perceived by the hearer as
legitimate.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>If our primary
obligation as Christians is to be in communion, and if communion is
about freedom and assistance to fulfill God's purpose for our
lives, then a Christian understanding of authority would seem to
accord most closely with the third definition suggested above:
influence flowing from the person or body who is "authoritative".
 Christian authority is not rooted in hierarchy; nor is it a mere
manifestation of power.  When James and John asked to sit at the
right and left hand of Jesus in glory, our Savior replied:</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>
You know that among the Gentiles those whom they
recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are
tyrants over them.  But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to
become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be
first among you must be slave of all.  For the Son of Man came not to
be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Jesus is the
pattern of servant leadership for his Church.  His authority was not
an authority of status or domination, but an authority based on His
willingness to share His power with all who would follow Him.  
Christian authority is life giving, for it is rooted in communion. 
In the Anglican tradition, the communal understanding of authority
has been described by the theologian Bishop Stephen Sykes as
"dispersed authority," authority that arises from a
continuous process of decision making amongst all participants.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A></SUP>
 This conception of authority underlies the synodical governance of
the Anglican Church of Canada.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B><U>AUTHORITY
AS JURISDICTION</U> </B>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Authority and
jurisdiction are not synonymous. Jesus is described as speaking with
authority but of having no jurisdiction over those to whom he spoke.
Jurisdiction is having the legal right to exercise authority. In the
polity of the Anglican Church of Canada there are four basic levels
of jurisdiction &#150; the parish, the diocese, the province and the
general synod. Our structure is confederate.  When the provinces of
Canada and Rupert's Land together with the dioceses of British
Columbia, Caledonia and New Westminster came together in the 1890s to
form the General Synod, the gathering defined those responsibilities
and duties which were within the jurisdictions of the General and
Provincial Synods leaving all undefined responsibilities and duties
to the jurisdiction of the dioceses.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Solemn
Declaration states that among the responsibilities of the General
Synod is "by the help of God to hold and maintain the Doctrine,
Sacraments and Discipline of Christ as the Lord hath commanded in His
Holy Word and as the Church of England hath received and set forth
the same."<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></SUP></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Declaration
of Principles states in Section 6 that "subject to the
provisions of Section 7 [which describes the jurisdiction of the
provincial Synod] the General Synod shall have authority and
jurisdiction in all matters affecting in any way the general interest
and well-being of the whole church and in particular:</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>	the
	definition of the doctrines of the Church in harmony with the Solemn
	Declaration adopted by this Synod."</P>
</OL>
<P></P>
<P>Sections 6
(Jurisdiction of General Synod) Section 7 (Fundamental principles)
and Section 7A (Ecclesiastical Offences and Disciplinary Proceedings)
can be amended by a two-thirds majority in each order voting a two
successive General Synods but changes cannot be effected without the
consent of the provincial synods. Diocesan synods need not be
consulted.</P>
<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>Section 11,c,I
of the Declaration of Principles states that canons dealing with
doctrine, worship or discipline and all alterations to such canons
must be referred for considerations (but not approval) to diocesan
and provincial synods before coming into force.<B> It seems clear,
therefore, that the intention of the founders of General Synod was to
place responsibility for matters of doctrine and discipline within
the jurisdiction of General Synod.</B></P>
<P>										</P>
<P>From time to
time, matters which affect the whole church but which are not covered
by the canons of General Synod arise. The best example in recent
years is the ordination of women to the priesthood. General Synod
established a procedure by which the issue could be studied and a
decision reached without enacting a canon. <B>If an issue is
understood to be one of doctrine or discipline, whether it be already
dealt with in the canons or not, it belongs within the jurisdiction
of General Synod.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>The difficulty
lies, of course, in the determination of which matters are of
doctrine and discipline. This is a question on which our task force
is  still working.<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="#sdfootnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP>
We have found two useful definitions of discipline:</P>
<P></P>
<P>"the
totality of ecclesiastical laws and customs regulating the religious
and moral life of the church."</P>
<P></P>
<P>and</P>
<P></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>In a
	general sense the right ordering of Christian life and community</P>
	<LI><P>In a
	specific sense ecclesiastic discipline refers to the canonical
	provisions for presentment and trial of a member of the clergy."<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A></SUP></P>
</OL>
<P></P>
<P>	We continue to
work on the refining of  our definitions of doctrine and discipline.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P></P>
<P>	</P>
<P></P>
<P><U><B>THE
SYNODICAL WAY</B></U></P>
<P></P>
<P>	We
are mindful that Anglican development of the received tradition of
synodical government has involved our whole Church in the life_giving
experience of walking together.  In this regard we have noted the
explanatory paragraphs in The Gift of Authority<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP>
which calls us to a continual practice of synodality. In  <U>The
Integrity of Anglicanism</U><SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP>
Stephen Sykes teases out this point when he speaks of the dialectical
nature of Anglican theology in which debate and even conflict are
part of our Anglican understanding of working our way through issues.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	This Anglican
method of doing theology involves us in the process of walking
together (synod) in the space of the middle way.  In this journey,
while we bring with us our several differences, yet we infuse our
relationship with patience and a loving acceptance of those who hold
different viewpoints. Living together in this fashion requires a
necessary ambiguity,  but it has also enabled us to grow and to move
forward along the way of becoming in greater maturity the People of
God.  The witness of this journey is the discovery that time is
needed to reflect together, to live in relationship with one another
so as to understand better what it means to be in relationship.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	We
want to advocate this pattern of civility as the path to continue
rather than assent to the temptation of a responsive reaction that
declares definitive statements which really have the potential to
separate, divide and exclude.  The experience of our Anglican way is
that decisions which affect the doctrine and discipline of the Church
involve a process which demands study, prayer and witness on the part
of the whole Church.  It must be remembered, however, because of our
human limitations those decisions must always be regarded as
provisional.  In the end the "Gamaliel principle"<SUP><A NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></SUP>
is the one sure test.  If a thing is of God it will flourish; if not
it will wither.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	<B><U>APPENDIX:
JURISDICTIONAL CANONS IN REVIEW</U></B></P>
<P></P>
<P>	We
have reviewed the constitutional documents of the General Synod and
the four Provincial Synods as they relate to doctrine and discipline.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	The
Solemn Declaration adopted by the General Synod in 1893, and
expressly accepted by the Provincial Synods of Rupert's Land,
Ontario and British Columbia, commits the Church to maintain the
Doctrine, Sacraments and Discipline of Christ as commanded by Him and
as the Church of England had received them and set them forth in its
formularies and in the Articles of Religion. The Synod of the
Province of Canada made a similar commitment, in different language,
in its 1861 Declaration of Principles.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	Originally,
"matters of doctrine, worship and discipline" were declared
to be within the jurisdiction of the General Synod subject to certain
rights and canons of the Provincial Synods of Canada and Rupert's
Land and of the synods of dioceses outside those provinces.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	Now,
the Declaration of Principles of the General Synod gives that Synod
authority and jurisdiction with respect to "the definition of
the doctrines of the Church in harmony with the Solemn Declaration."
None of the provincial synod constitutions assert provincial
jurisdiction over any matter of doctrine. 
</P>
<P></P>
<P>	The
General Synod also has authority and jurisdiction with respect to
several aspects of ecclesiastical discipline, i.e. the trial of
persons accused of ecclesiastical offences. The constitutional
documents of the Synods of the Provinces of Canada, Rupert's
Land and Ontario say those synods have authority with respect to the
ecclesiastical discipline and trial of bishops. That overlaps, and
may conflict with, the authority of the General Synod . Those
documents, as well as the Declaration of Principles of the General
Synod , give the provincial synods jurisdiction with respect to the
Provincial Courts of Appeal, the regulation of the ministrations of
clergy and the oaths and subscriptions of clergy. The Constitution of
the Provincial Synod of British Columbia neatly defines that Synod's
jurisdiction as "the power to deal with all matters affecting
general interest of the church within its territorial jurisdiction
other than those delegated to the General Synod ." It does not
contain any specific reference to either doctrine or discipline.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	Canons
and resolutions of the General Synod of a coercive character or
involving penalties or disabilities are not operative in the Province
of Rupert's Land until they are accepted by the synod of that
province. The constitution of the Provincial Synod of Rupert's
Land also preserves its right to pass on any subject that fell within
that synod's jurisdiction in 1893 when the General Synod was
created.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	Acting
under its authority in matters affecting the general interest and
well-being of the whole Church, the General Synod has legislated with
respect to discipline in the broad sense of the right ordering of
Christian life and community, e.g. in certain provisions of the
licensing, discipline and marriage canons.</P>
