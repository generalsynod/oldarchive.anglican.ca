The Trustees reported to the Pension Committee that they have had
considerable discussion with respect to ethical investing and that
they are trying to find a balance so that their actions can reflect
ethical principles and yet maximize investment returns.  They pointed
out that it is important to have a national policy on socially
responsible investing which would include ethical principles and
screening processes which could be applied to all investments rather
than case by case.  The Trustees are presently working with the Fund
Managers with regard to establishing an ethical screening process. 
Although it is not the mandate of the Trustees, they offered to
provide assistance in establishing an ethical investment policy for
the Church.  At its meeting on March 17, 2001, the Council of General
Synod passed a resolution accepting this offer of the Trustees. 
Attached is the Pension Committee's response to the various parties.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The Standing
Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce issued a Report on
the Governance Practices of Institutional Investors in November 1998.
 This Report included a recommendation that pension plans in Canada
adopt industry best practices with respect to plan governance. 
Specifically, the Committee recommended that plan administrators
&quot;adopt one of the ACPM (Association of Canadian Pension
Management), PIAC (Pension Investment Association of Canada) and OSFI
(Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institution) guidelines
and report annually to pension plan members setting out how they
comply with, or exceed, the adopted set of guidelines, and explaining
why they do not comply if they choose not to do so&quot;.  In 1999,
as a result of this recommendation, a joint task force of ACPM, PIAC,
and OSFI produced a self-assessment questionnaire for completion by
the pension plan administrators to assess their governance practices.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The
financial status of the Plan for the policy year August 1, 1999 to
July 31, 2000 was satisfactory for the second consecutive year. 
According to Eckler Partners analysis, the Plan generated a marginal
surplus of $130,825, when added to the opening (surplus) balance of
$2,525 at August 1, 1999, the cumulative surplus at July 31 was
$133,350.  Exceptional investment results were the greatest
contributor to these positive results.</FONT></P>

Pension Committee is extremely concerned about the high number of
claims and in particular, the high number of psychological claims.
The total number of claims as of March 2001 was 57 of which 37% are
of a psychological nature.  The Committee is also concerned about the
high premium costs for this coverage which is totally paid by the
Plan members. Since the inception of the Plan in 1994, the employees
have seen their premiums increase from 1% to 1.75% of Salary.  </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>It was
agreed that it was extremely important that the Pension Committee
should continue to raise their concerns about clergy wellness to the
Council of General Synod and the House of Bishops. Al Lamb, a member
of the Pension Committee, produced a discussion paper on &quot;Clergy
Wellness&quot; as a result of his concern about &quot;Clergy Stress&quot;
(Appendix 3).  It was also suggested that dioceses be encouraged to
conduct stress management workshops.</FONT></P>
