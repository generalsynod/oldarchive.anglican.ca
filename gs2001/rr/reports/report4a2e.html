<p class="resNum">Report 010-3</p>
<p class="resSubj">Pensions Committee -- CLERGY WELLNESS</p>
<P>It is 29 years since Alvin Toffler's &quot;Future Shock&quot;
focussed our attention on the impact of rapid technological and
social change. Future Shock was his term for the psychological
illness that occurs when changes take place at a pace that exceeds
our capacity to adapt and we succumb to the resulting stress. Since
Toffler's book we have certainly witnessed a dramatic pace of social
and technological change, impacting on our institutions, roles and
attitudes? and the pace of change seems to be accelerating.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The corporate world has struggled to
deal with the stress and burnout that has accompanied rapid changes
in technology, and the dislocation of a decade of downsizing.
Personnel resources have been added to provide counseling and
training to assist employees in dealing with the stress. Clergy in
many parishes have found themselves to be part of the support system
for these stress ridden individuals and are fully aware of the
devastating impact that stress can have on an individual and his or
her family.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Much of the literature and corporate
response has focused on how to help the casualties, &quot;cope&quot;
with stress, rather than on eliminating the cause of the stress.
Indeed, some stress and frustration is an essential motivation to
learning and growth so there is a natural reluctance for us to admit
that we have any difficulty in coping with stress? even pride in some
cases with how much stress we can cope with!</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Since Toffler wrote his book, the
church, too, has encountered many internal changes as well as facing
the dramatic change that has taken place in the external environment.
Individual clergy persons generally seem to recognize that there is a
good deal of stress inherent in their vocation? many might say more
than in other vocations because ordination is a commitment of one's
whole life to the church and not just one's work hours. It is my
impression that the laity</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>may not fully share this view. In the
extreme, I have heard it suggested that &quot;the clergy have it
pretty good because they only have to really work on Sundays? and
even then only for half a day&quot;. To the extent that the
significant pressures inherent in the clergy role are recognized
there is often an accompanying view (even among some clergy) that the
clergy are &quot;too blessed to be stressed&quot;. While the Anglican
Church has not been at the forefront in dealing with the question of
stress in the work place, some steps have been taken.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Larger Dioceses employ a Personnel
person to ensure that there is someone available to respond to the
needs of Clergy and Lay employees. Calgary Diocese has established
the position of Pastor to the Clergy. The Diocese of Eastern
Newfoundland established a Clergy Wellness Protocol Committee in 1997
that recommended a series of seminars for clergy and spouses and a
training session to be used with parish groups? all focussed on
alleviating unnecessary stress. Huron Diocese held a Clergy
Conference last year on the topic of Clergy Wellness and has some
looking into what is being done elsewhere. So there is evidence that
in some areas the need for action is being recognized. A search on
the Internet for work on &quot;Clergy stress&quot; identified 5,233
items. While many of these related to churches in the United States
and Europe there were Canadian items as well? and some related
specifically to the Anglican Church.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Clearly recognition of the problem is
an important first step to dealing with it. Many of the articles note
the difficulties that professionals have in acknowledging that they
are feeling excessively stressed. &quot;We may fear that having
stress&nbsp;related symptoms or just reaching out for support would
seem like an impression of inadequacy. So we hide or deny our
emotions and physical disease, and plod on, until we eventually burn
out.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Is There A Problem?</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>A report on the membership of the
Anglican Church of Canada's pension plan, that of the 2061
non&nbsp;retired ordained members in the plan, 485 of are &quot;inactive&quot;.
Further study revealed that a number of the latter group were
classified as inactive as they have transferred to churches in other
countries, or are serving as chaplains, or are teaching in church
educational facilities. After excluding these there are still 18% of
the ordained clergy classified as inactive, which seems like a very
large number given the nature of the commitment in ordination. This
data might at least suggest that there is a problem. The number of
Anglican clergy on disability leave for psychological reasons
provides further evidence that stress related problems are as
prevalent among this group as in industry. In a survey of clergy in
the United States, 38% of clergy identified burnout as the greatest
danger to them and their families, 80% named isolation as the number
one problem that they face and 80% feel that their occupation
negatively effects their families. Anecdotal information on the
situation in the Anglican Church in Canada suggests that this is an
issue that should be looked at.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Ottawa Diocese has had a variety of
support groups in place for its theology students/interns and for
newly ordained. However, it is not easy to &quot;institutionalize&quot;
support as it is difficult to establish the open trust that is
essential to support an individual when the support group is imposed
on the clergy. Moreover, while the support of newly ordained clergy
is very important, the pressures of stress typically emerge at a much
later stage and long after the support group has been disbanded.
Indeed, the Diocese places the onus for clergy wellness on the clergy
themselves and to this end a includes a self help guide in the Clergy
Personnel Policy which was prepared some years ago and provided to
all clergy in the Diocese.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Diocese has also made it possible
for clergy to avail themselves of courses and programmes that deal
with stress issues. For the clergy who take advantage of such
facilities this is very helpful but there is a risk that the people
most in need feel that their calendar is already overbooked and find
it difficult to take the time for any additional activities.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>There seems to be a good deal of
evidence that the steps taken so far have not been sufficient to
adequately cope with clergy stress and certainly not to deal with
underlying causes of the stress. Individual Clergy members have
concurred in this conclusion? but it is less clear that the Clergy
&quot;corporately&quot; agree that there is a problem? Until that
happens it is unlikely that any support initiatives will be fully
effective.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If there is a problem, Is It Clearly
Defined?</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>If it is agreed that a problem exists
then it is important to try to specify quite precisely what that
problem is. Once well defined, a problem is normally relatively easy
to resolve. The first step may be to determine what aspects of
personal stress are unique to the clergy role. Some of the specific
difficulties that have been suggested include the following:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in; text-indent: -0.18in">-	Isolation
from his or her community. The priest's responsibilities regarding
the Parish has traditionally made it difficult to &quot;de&nbsp;role&quot;
in order to seek support from within the community in times when the
Priest is stressed. It is often difficult to seek help from fellow
Clergy, because we don't want to admit to colleagues that we are
stressed.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in; text-indent: -0.18in">-	The
&quot;empowerment of the laity&quot; has changed the role of the
clergy and this has proven to be stressful at times. Some have
suggested that managing Lay volunteers takes more time than doing the
task themselves. Others are concerned that sharing the pastoral role
is an abdication of their responsibilities and some feel threatened
by the loss of control that is involved in delegating the authority
that must accompany the delegation of an area of responsibility.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in; text-indent: -0.18in">-	The
Priest is trained and ordained to love and serve the people among
whom he or she works, to preach, to declare God's forgiveness, to
pronounce God's blessing, to preside at the administration of the
Sacraments? but the installed Priest finds the &quot;job&quot; is one
of management, administration meetings, training volunteers and being
on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>More generally, stress arises when
expectations greatly exceed the resources available to meet them. The
stress can be reduced or eliminated by lowering the expectations or
by increasing the resources or some combination of both.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Expectations for the role of the clergy
may be set by the Bishop, by the congregation, and by the clergy
themselves. How the clergy perceive these expectations may be
different than the actual expectations, but it will be the perceived
expectations that the clergy are trying to meet.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>How can we reduce the identified causes
of stress for Clergy?</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To begin with, we should assure that
the actual and perceived expectations are the same. Thus we should
assure that there is some process that involves the Priest, the
Bishop and the congregation in establishing a clearly defined and
agreed role for the Priest.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Having reached an agreed understanding
of the expectations of the clergy role, we must assure that the
resources available to the clergy are consistent with the goals.
These resources include not only the authority, finances, time,
talent, managerial skills, and training, but also the support
systems, time and resources for personal care and re&nbsp;creation.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>There should then be a system of
accountability in place to review the expectations and resources
periodically to be sure that they have not gotten out of balance.
Individual members of the congregation often have a relatively
limited understanding of what the clergy do and of their specific
role and responsibilities. As a consequence the congregation's
expectations may not be well balanced with the resources and support
they are providing their clergy. Each member sees some aspects of the
clergy role but a forum is needed to share these parts so that an
agreed total role can be fully understood, appreciated and supported.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The approach taken in Eastern
Newfoundland</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Diocese of Eastern Newfoundland
established a Clergy Wellness Commission in 1997 and reported their
recommendations in June 1999. These recommendations may well provide
the basis to develop a consistent approach for the Anglican Church to
resolve the concerns outlined above.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>&quot;The Wellness Protocol Committee&quot;
was given a mandate to:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in; text-indent: -0.18in"><I>1.	Bring
a proposed budget to the next session of Synod to implement a
Wellness Protocol and fund the professional resources needed to deal
with this issue.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.83in; text-indent: -0.22in"><I>2.	Provide
each cleric with a directory of professional resources available to
address, any spiritual, physical, financial and other related issues.</I></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Committee concluded
that: <I>'Ministry must be a mutual exercise, and we need to
understand the stress that Christian Leadership places ordained
clergy under. &quot; It </I>was hoped that the Commission's
recommendations would enable clergy and laity to work together for
the benefit of the whole church. In summary their recommendations are
set out as follows:</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.22in; text-indent: -0.21in">1.	They
stressed the importance of clergy and their families paying attention
to their physical, spiritual and emotional well being. They adapted
an Ottawa Diocesan &quot;Clergy Self Care Guide&quot; and they
emphasized <I>&quot;that it is the responsibility of the Clergy and
their loved ones to seek the help when it is needed&quot;</I></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.22in; text-indent: -0.22in">2.	They
recommended <I>&quot;that all parishes retain a copy of the Community
Resource Directory? a comprehensive listing of social service
agencies, government organizations, social workers, counsellors,
psychologists, etc. that is updated every five years or so. &quot;</I></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.22in; text-indent: -0.22in"><I>3.	&quot;The
work of the Committee should be continued. A reconstituted Committee
must take responsibility for the organization of the seminars which
clergy had indicated a strong interest in. We could set up a Wellness
Link to our Diocesan web site where new information about books,
seminars, etc., could be exchanged This could include an online forum
discussing wellness issues. We should encourage the faculty at
Queen's College to train the students to become aware of these
concerns&quot;</I></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.22in; text-indent: -0.22in"><I>4.	&quot;Education
of the laity: We should make a strong effort to educate the laity
about wellness issues We need to emphasize that lay people and clergy
have a Christian responsibility to care for each other. Ministry must
be a mutual exercise, and we need to understand the stress that
Christian leadership places ordained clergy under. Lay people and
clergy should discuss boundary issues together, and discuss their
expectation for each other? </I>(sensitivity to other members of
clergy family and their needs)? <I>We feel that a series of training
sessions for </I>Vestry <I>members, perhaps done on a Deanery basis,
may help lay people identify some of these stressful situations, and
to develop some ways in which they can assist&quot;</I></P>
