<H2>Liturgical Celebration of the Waterloo Declaration</H2>


	
	<p>
	A joint working group of Anglicans and Lutherans 
	is preparing resources for suggested use on 
	October 28, 2001 (the Sunday beginning the week which 
	includes Reformation Day and All Saints) but the 
	following resources may be useful for people 
	and parishes wishing to mark July 8th, the day 
	of the church service celebrating the expected 
	signing of the Waterloo Declaration. (See the 
	website news story, 
	<a href="https://anglican.ca/news/online/news.html?newsItem=2001-06-12_ll-b.news" target="_blank">Joint synod service: on 
	ice, with a twist</a>, for more 
	information about the joint service.)
	<p>
	The working group reminds people to check the 
	Synod website <https://anglican.ca/synod/> to 
	see if the motion passed before 
	celebrating on July 8th!
	<P>
	The readings for July 8th are Genesis 12:1-9, 
	Psalm 133, Ephesians 4:1-7, 11-16, and 
	John 17:1-6, 11, 17-26.
	<P>
	We are singing 'Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, 
	'As the Grains of Wheat', 'Let all Mortal Flesh 
	Keep Silence', 'Let us Talents and Tongues 
	Employ', 'One Bread One Body', 'Jesu Jesu', 
	'Come and Journey with a Saviour', plus a new 
	hymn written for the occasion.  As postlude 
	the combined choirs will sing 'We are Marching 
	in the Light of God'.
	<p>
	The Collect from the joint service is:
	<p>
	Loving Source of all creation, in Jesus Christ 
	you have united heaven and earth.  Grant that 
	we who share in the first fruits of that union 
	may work for its fulfillment in the power of 
	the Holy Spirit. We ask this in the name of 
	the Incarnate Word, who with you and the Holy 
	Spirit lives and reigns now and for ever.  
	<p align="right">
		<b>
			Amen
		</b>
	</p>
	<P>
	The actual signing of the text will follow the 
	format of renewal of baptismal vows, shaped 
	around the acknowledgements of Waterloo.  
	This part of the liturgy could readily be 
	done locally:
	<P>
	<b>
		Presider:
	</b>  
		We have acknowledged each other as churches 
		sharing in the apostolic faith.  Let us 
		confess that faith, as we say,
	<p>
	<i>
		All:
	</i> 
		(the Creed)
	<P>
	<b>
		Presider:
	</b>  
		Will you continue together in the apostles' 
		teaching and fellowship, in making new 
		disciples by water and the Holy Spirit, 
		in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?
		<p>
	<i>
		Congregation:
	</i>  
		We will, with God's help.
	<p>
	<b>
		Presider:
	</b>  
		We have acknowledged each other as churches in 
		which the Gospel is preached in its purity 
		and the sacraments duly administered.  Will 
		you join with your Lutheran and Anglican 
		sisters and brothers in proclaiming by word 
		and example the good news of God in Christ?
	<p>
	<i>
		Congregation:
	</i>  
		We will, with God's help.
	<P>
	<b>
		Presider:
	</b>  
		We have acknowledged each other's ministries as 
		gifts of God's Holy Spirit to equip the people 
		of God for the work of ministry.  Will you 
		as Christians in full communion seek and serve 
		Christ in all persons, loving your neighbour 
		as yourself, striving for justice and peace, 
		and respecting the dignity of every human 
		being?
	<p>
	<i>
		Congregation:
	</i>  
		We will, with God's help.

	<P>
	(It is at this point that the Declaration of 
	Full Communion would be declared and signed.)  
	People locally could add:
	<P>
	<i>
		All:
	</i> 
		We affirm and celebrate the declaration of 
		full communion between our churches. May 
		the Lord who has given us the will to make 
		this declaration give us the grace and 
		power to live it.
	<br>
		<p align="right">
			<b>
				Amen
			</b>
		</p>
	
	<h3>
		Prayers of the People
	</h3> 
	<BR>
	(on July 8th these will be read in a variety 
	of languages)
	<P>
	God of promise, we celebrate this day the work 
	of your Spirit among us. We praise you for the 
	many who have heeded your Spirit and worked to 
	bring us to this celebration of our common 
	ministry of Word and Sacrament.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<p>
	God of promise, you give us signs of your love 
	in water, in bread, in wine, the cross, the Word, 
	and in all of creation.  By your Spirit enable 
	us always and everywhere to celebrate these 
	signs among us as we seek to be a visible sign 
	of your people's unity in apostolic life, mission 
	and ministry.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<P>
	God of promise, in calling us to be your own, 
	you made us a chosen people, a holy nation, a 
	royal priesthood.  We your people, acknowledging 
	who we are and whose we are, commit ourselves 
	to the ministry of all believers in service 
	to you and to your creation.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<p>
	God of promise, you place before us many ways of 
	service and ministry and grant us the necessary 
	gifts to meet the challenges of this ministry. 
	Guide us by your Spirit as we explore how we 
	might best enable the ministry of all your 
	people.
	<p>
	<i>	
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<P>
	God of promise, you have brought us into a common 
	pilgrimage.  Strengthen us in our commitment to 
	seek understanding in all matters of our common 
	life.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<P>
	God of promise, lead us by your Spirit not only to 
	seek, but to rely upon regular collaboration and 
	consultation in all matters that our common 
	ministry will indeed be uncommon, and our 
	ordinary service, extraordinary.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<P>
	God of promise, foster understanding among us as 
	we, especially the members of the Joint Commission, 
	take counsel together, nationally, regionally, and 
	locally so that our commitment to each other will 
	embody before the world a life of full communion 
	fellowship.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>
	<P>
	God of promise, let ours be a unity not only in 
	word but visible in our daily lives.  Grant us 
	trust in each other's gifts, respect for each 
	other's insights into the faith, and mutual 
	love that nurtures and supports our life 
	together.
	<p>
	<i>
		Lord, hear our prayer.
	</i>

	<h3>
		The Exchange of the Peace
	</h3>
	<P>
	<b>
		Presider:
	</b>  
		My sisters and brothers, as Christians in full 
		communion, let us exchange a sign of peace we 
		share.  The peace of the Lord be always with 
		you.
	<p>
	<i>
		Congregation:
	</i>  
		And also with you.
