                 MONTREAL (May 29, 1998) 
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 In a nine-day meeting here, the Anglican Church of Canada’s chief governing body
                 approved legislation bringing the church closer to Lutherans, opposing euthanasia and
                 cloning, and expressing the church’s support to partner churches in several oppressed
                 or war-torn countries.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 The church also approved motions asking for government action on several social
                 policy issues.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 In the first meeting it has held in Montreal in 30 years, the 300-member General Synod
                 also spent a considerable amount of time reflecting on "nation and identity" and on
                 what it means to be a minority voice in a society as diverse as Canada’s.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 The theme of this General Synod, a body which meets every three years in a different
                 part of the country, was "Lift every voice -- Faisons entendre nos voix" which was
                 meant to help members focus on those who are often ignored or unheard.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 In his opening address at the start of synod, Archbishop Michael Peers, the primate, set
                 the tone when he told delegates that one of the least heard voices in the Canadian
                 Anglican church was that of French Canada. He challenged synod members to pay
                 particular attention to that voice during the gathering.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Synod members spent a whole evening listening to panel members representing
                 different voices or geographical parts of the country speak about what it means to be a
                 part of the Canadian whole. 
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Synod members also heard a presentation from the church’s indigenous members, a
                 group that is working to implement a "Native Covenant" which would give it greater
                 autonomy within the church.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Host bishop Andrew Hutchison of Montreal delivered a major address in which he
                 expressed the difficulties involved in leading a church that represents a very small
                 number of Anglophones in an overwhelmingly Francophone province. 
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 In his speech, Bishop Hutchison also argued that while the church has no mandate to
                 play a role in partisan politics, it is bound by conscience to take strong positions on
                 matters involving principles such as peace, justice and reconciliation.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Synod members took him to heart, passing more than a dozen resolutions affirming the
                 Canadian church’s stand against oppression, injustice, violence and war in several
                 parts of the world.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Through some of these resolutions, the Canadian Anglican church offered expressions
                 of solidarity to partner churches and the people of Kenya, Sudan and Columbia who
                 suffer from war or political oppression. Members voted to ask Ottawa to play a greater
                 mediation role between Cuba and the United States.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Meeting the week that Pakistan exploded a number of nuclear devices in response to
                 similar tests carried out by India, synod delegates called on the Canadian government
                 to renounce the use of nuclear weapons and to exert pressure on other governments to
                 do so as well.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 They voted to ask the church’s ecojustice committee to produce resources to enable
                 Canadian congregations "to study the Just War theory and its implications for Christian
                 response to war and militarism."
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Members also called on the federal government to initiate a broad process of public
                 consultation whenever it negotiates multilateral agreements on investment and trade
                 and to consider the implications of such pacts, especially on the most disadvantaged
                 members of society such as the elderly, the very young and indigenous peoples.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Members also voted to ask the Prime Minister to apologize to Inuit people displaced
                 from traditional hunting areas on the east coast of Hudson Bay and Baffin Island to the
                 High Arctic in the 1950s;
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 In the area of social policy, General Synod approved resolution saying it cannot
                 support euthanasia and assisted suicide. The resolution described such measures as "a
                 failure of human community."
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 The church also called on Ottawa to prohibit the cloning of human beings.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 The resolution with what may have the broadest impact for the Anglican community
                 itself, was one commending for study a report urging "full communion" between
                 Canadian Anglicans and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 Full communion would not be an actual merger of the two churches, but means that
                 each would recognize the other’s clergy, rites and sacraments. It could lead to extensive
                 sharing of resources and even personnel between the two denominations. Reactions to
                 that report will be gathered by both churches in the next three years and considered
                 again when their respective governing bodies next meet in the year 2001.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 One of the most arduous parts of the proceedings, held in a sweltering gymnasium at
                 McGill University, was a debate on "human rights principles" for church members and
                 employees that would have legislated protection from discrimination on the basis of
                 age, sex, sexual orientation, family or marital status, race, colour, ethnic origin, ancestry,
                 disability, creed and socio-economic status.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 The often emotional debate on that resolution stretched over three days and the
                 proposal was ultimately narrowly defeated after synod members failed to agree on a way
                 to marry theological concerns to language more commonly associated with civil courts
                 proceedings.
<br><img src="<? echo $baseURL ?>/mm/standard_art/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="10">
                 General Synod, which consists of bishops, clergy and lay people elected to the task in
                 each of the church’s 30 dioceses, meets every three years.</FONT>
