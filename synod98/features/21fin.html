<b>Thursday, May 21, 1998</b><p>
<b>1.	The Opening of Synod</b><p>
The opening service of the 35th General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada
was held at Christ Church Cathedral, Montreal, Quebec. The Most Rev. Michael
Peers, Primate, presided. The Rt. Rev. French Chang-Him, Bishop of the
Seychelles, preached. The text for the sermon was "Lift every Voice, <i>Faisons
entendre nos voix." </i><p>
Youth members of Synod presented the Bishop of Montreal, The Rt. Rev. Andrew
Hutchison, with a silver maple tree to be planted on the grounds of the
University of McGill on Saturday, May 23. The tree was a sign of new life and
healing of the earth, and of solidarity with those who suffered and ministered
to the suffering during the ice storms which devastated much of eastern Ontario
and Qu&eacute;bec this past winter. <p>
The Rt. Rev. John Hannen, Bishop of Caledonia, and Rod Robinson presented the
Primate with a button blanket and mitre on behalf of the Nisga'a people, in
recognition of support from the Anglican Church of Canada for the Nisaga'a
people in their search for justice during the past 25 years. In addition, the
Primate was given a Nisga'a name which means "the servant of God". The name
will be assumed by successive Primates, as will the button blanket and mitre.

<b>3.	Presidential Address</b><p>
The full text of the Primate's address is now available in Doc. 031 and also on
the General Synod website www.anglican.ca/synod98.<p>
At the beginning of his address, the Primate noted that recently his spiritual
director had pressed him to write down, in a few words, the fundamental
commitments in his life. In concluding his address to synod, the Primate quoted
from this spiritual exercise:<p>
<i>"Because these affirmations are rooted in a deep commitment to the
experience I have of the Lord as incarnate Brother, I affirm with the church
that, like Jesus, I am a human being and that I think nothing human alien to
me. Especially, I strive to affirm not only my own personal distinctiveness,
but to move the church to make the same affirmation in championing particularly
all her minorities - of age, of gender, of ethnicity, of sexuality - and to
work towards the day when the whole church can make joyfully all the difficult
and necessary affirmations which spring from the incarnate love of God.</i><p>
<i>"I perceive that my affirmations all live within powerful, inescapable,
divine paradoxes, manifested in the governing realities of my life and all
human life - space and time. The paradox of time draws from me the special
commitment to be faithful to the past, to interpret that past to the church as
foundation for what now is, to admit the sins and failures of that past, to
work for their transformation. It draws from me, as well, a commitment to
strive to speak and act in such a way that the future church will find, in my
words and actions, as much as possible to be edified by and as little as
possible to be ashamed of.</i><p>
<i>"That voice is mine. I pray that you may find in these words some connection
with your own affirmations, and that, together, we can commit ourselves to
words and deeds pleasing to our God and challenging to our world.</i><p>
<i>"`Get you up to a high mountain...' So, let us `get up' and begin our work
together in this gathering. With a good and generous spirit, and mindful of
God's grace, let us undertake to proclaim and to reveal `Our God is
here.'</i><p>
In table groups, members discussed the Primate's address by focusing on two
questions: Where do the Primate's words coincide with yours? What would you add
to make the voice more complete, more reflective of the whole Church?<p>
<b>4.	Resolutions</b><p>
The Synod made the following decisions:<p>
AGREED on second reading to amend Section 3 of the Declaration of Principles to
include the appointment of two representatives of Anglican Religious Orders
with communities in Canada that are recognized by the House of Bishops.
(A-10)<p>
AGREED that section 8 of the Constitution be amended to reflect the change in
the Declaration of Principles in resolution A10.  (A-21)<p>
<b>5.	Triennium Report</b><p>
Members viewed <i>Triennium,</i> a video report of the work of the General
Synod committees and councils in the last triennium.<p>
<b>6.	Forums</b><p>
Members attended the first in a series of 7 forums designed to provide an
opportunity to discuss critical themes that are shaping the life of the
Anglican Church of Canada and to explore how these themes are being experienced
locally, nationally, and internationally, and to help members become aware of
the many voices in our church; achieve clarity about the issues for discussion
and decision at Synod; and to assist in setting directions for the future. The
forums will take place over the next three days, and members will choose one
forum to attend each day.<p>
The focus of the <i>Partnerships</i> forum (www.partnership@faith.com) was the
<i>Preparing the Way </i>priority "to strengthen our mission and develop
partnerships outside Canada." The goal of the forum was "to be a window on the
world, to enlarge the sense of family, and to help General Synod members to
discover network links with others. <p>
Members heard an introduction from the forum chairperson, Dorothy Davies
Flindall, and listened to a panel address the question, "What does partnership
mean?" Panelists included Stuart Pike and Sim&eacute;a de Souza Meldrum of the
Partners in Mission Committee, and Marion Saunders and Lakshmi Daniel of the
Primate's World Relief and Development Fund Committee. In table groups, members
discussed questions on partnerships: sharing gifts, the Anglican Communion's
Partners in Mission process, fair trade, Volunteers in Mission, foreign aid,
companion dioceses, immigration, refugees/uprooted people, Jubilee,
multiculturalism, youth and face to face encounters of partnerships.<p>
The focus for the <i>Northern Lights</i> forum was the <i>Preparing the Way
</i>priority "to strengthen commitment of the whole church to domestic mission
in partnership with the Council of the North and to work with the Council of
the North to move towards self-sufficiency." The goal was to provide an
opportunity for members of General Synod to express their feelings, opinions,
and concerns about the historic mission of our church in the North and the
relationship of that mission to the church in the rest of Canada."<p>
In table groups, members discussed the Church in the North and the Church in
the South, The Church in the North and Aboriginal Peoples, the Church in the
North and new models of ministry, and the Church in the North and
Self-Sufficiency. <p>
Following the forums, members met in diocesan caucuses to prepare nominations
for the Council of General Synod. <p>

The Most Rev. David Crawley, Chair of the Resolutions Committee, who outlined

outlined their role in assisting with the proceedings of the Synod and
introduced Mr. Robert Dickson, Chair of the Expenditures Committee and Ms.
Elizabeth Hutchinson, Chair of the Worship Committee. <p>
<b>8.	Introduction of Partners</b><p>
Each overseas ecumenical and partner was introduced by his/her  diocesan
representative. Two of the partners, Dr. Janet Somerville and Bishop Telmar
