Welcome to your first issue of Perspectives, an interactive nightly newsletter companion to our full electronic coverage of the General Synod.
It's my hope that Perspectives will add to our extensive news coverage by helping bring you the colour, fun, and emotion of the Synod and host diocese.

A very important part of our coverage is the Synod98 Live! web site.  You can find it at https://www.anglican.ca/synod98/  The site will be updated several times throughout the day with news, live images from the Synod, and -- if we can pull it off -- a nightly radio show via RealAudio!  Be sure to drop by the site, bookmark it, and return each day.

As you are reading this, across the first Synod members are arriving in Montreal from across Canada.  That's why I'm starting with an "Issue 0" -- published one day before the General Synod actually starts.  This way, you can get familiar with the various sections of Perspectives before it officially gets underway Thursday.

First, two things to know:

INTERACTIVE
Perspectives is an interactive newsletter.  That means I'll be relying on you for much of the content.  What are your thoughts as you read?  How do you feel about decisions being made in Montreal?  What would you like to say to Anglicans across the country?  If you have any feedback, either now or throughout the next two weeks, please email me at owner-acc-synodnews@anglican.ca.

SPREADABLE
We want this to be a promiscuous newsletter!  Email it to your friends (and invite them to subscribe too!)... print them out and post them on your church bulletin board... fax copies to your wardens.

Perspectives will be sent to you late each evening, so that it will be ready when you wake up.  Generally speaking, it will have seven main sections:

-- The First Word: This will be an introduction from your humble scribe, mostly containing information about the newsletter itself.

-- Quick Takes: A half dozen or so short, punchy news items from, well, off the beaten track.  Interesting tidbits that probably don't come anywhere near being "newsworthy," but are important nonetheless.

-- Did You Know: Each night, you'll learn an interesting tidbit about the General Synod and Anglican Church.  Prepare to be surprised!

-- Reflections: The Reflections section will be a short, hopefully insightful, essay -- some from me, some from Synod members, some from readers like you!  Have something to say now?  Email me!

-- Snickerings: Get your favourite Anglican joke dusted off and contribute your best chuckle to this joke section.

-- Glance Ahead: A look ahead to the next day's Synod agenda and television broadcast lineup.

-- Your Turn: Consider this the Letters To The Editor section, a place for you to comment on what you read.

So, now that you know how it works, let's get started shall we?  <grin>

Q: How many Anglicans does it take to change a light bulb?
A: Anglicans don't change.
