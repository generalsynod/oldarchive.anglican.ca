Welcome back from the weekend, and a special welcome to the many people who signed up for our reports on Sunday.  I presume the word got out in parish bulletins! :)

Much of the formal "business" of the General Synod starts to take place from here on, as members will be starting to spend more time on the Plenary floor voting on motions, etc.  Although this post-weekend issue is a bit sparse, you can expect it will pick up as we get into the decisions of the Synod.

A few highlights today... first, members will dive into the Licencing of Clergy canon, a topic which has garnered the most requests for more information from our Internet coverage.  As well, at 2pm for an hour, members will be debating and likely voting on the commissioning of alternative liturgies for use by diocesan bishops.  Check the web site ( https://www.anglican.ca/synod98/ ) for coverage of breaking news as it develops.

CLOSER TIES TO LUTHERANS APPROVED
Synod members have overwhelming approval in principle to a declaration that would see their church and the Canadian Lutheran church move closer to a full sharing of each other's gifts and ministries.  They approved for study the "Called to Full Communion" document, one the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada earlier gave its overwhelming consent.  (See full news release on this story, following.)

GENERAL SYNOD ON TELEVISION TONIGHT
The first of our five half-hour television broadcasts begins tonight on Vision TV.  Tune in at 7pm (Eastern/Pacific).

GET YOUR COMMENTS ON TV TONIGHT!
If you have comments about the decisions made thus far at the synod, or have comments about the wider national church, you have a chance to see your comments aired this evening on the television program.  Email your comments to voices@anglican.ca with the word "tv" in the subject line.
Because of production timelines, your comments must be received by 1pm Eastern/10am Pacific today (Monday).

MORE BEER!!
Following a page and a half of relatively mundane notes and announcements, this morning's orders of the day (reproduced below in our "Today" section) have this short notice added: "There is the usual Pub tonight in Tomlinson Hall but without wine from either Niagara or Nova Scotia, but perhaps with more beer than the last night."

ACYOMYMANIA
Saturday morning, members were treated to a very funny short video of "Acronym Anonymous."  It featured General Synod coordinator Jamie Tomlinson, who told a small support group "Hello.  My name is Jamie.  And I'm an Acronymaniac.  It started with the Primate's Fund... PWRDF.  Then soon, I was using ACC and WWW.  And let's not even talk about all the interfaith groups... ICIFRIC..."

FIDELITY AND INTEGRITY -- SIDE BY SIDE
It's one of the wonderful oddities of the Synod... the Fidelity and Integrity organizations (both at opposite ends of the debate on same-sex unions) happen to have their booths side-by-side in the display area.  One Integrity member tells me it was a deliberate placement, to demonstrate that the two groups can communicate and work together.  Integrity has been one of the more popular booths, certainly due in part to their available free fans.  With the Plenary hall uncomfortably warm for many members, more than a few have availed themselves of the free cooling devices, which have a clever sticker attached reading "Fan of Integrity."

WEEKEND TIME-OFF
One synod member, the Rev. Alan Perry from Montreal, is writing an excellent daily diary (on the acc-synod98 list).  I was off-site during the weekend, so I was delighted to read Alan's description of the Saturday evening plans.  "We were treated to a wonderful reception at the McCord Museum of Canadian History, followed by dinner at the Eaton's restaurant on the 9th floor of the department store. If that sounds a little strange, allow me to explain that the restaurant is an art-deco period piece, designed as a replica of the dining room on the ocean-liner "Ile de France". The meal was delicious (and yet another opportunity to talk to new people), and was followed by greetings from several dignitaries and an indescribable show put on by Natalie Choquette -"la Diva", a comic opera character.)"

STEVE'S ADVENTURES IN SYNOD-LAND
Speaking of other unofficial correspondants, synod member Steve Koning from the Diocese of Calgary has been writing daily dispatches on his observations.  You can read his comments online at https://www.agt.net/public/diocese/steve.htm

CORRECTION
Nick Jesson, director of the Saskatoon Centre for Ecumenism, caught an error in our last issue Friday.  The Rev. Telmor Sartison is is Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Canada (ELCIC), not the Lutheran Church of Canada (LCC).

In the afternoon delegates attended one of two forums: In Full Harmony and New Ways of Working.

The focus of In Full Harmony was Preparing the Way  priority "to clarify Anglican identity, doctrine, liturgy and worship;" the goal: to explore our comprehensiveness and diversity: how our many Anglican voices blend in harmony."

In table groups members discussed topics which included: common prayer in Canada; common prayer in the Communion; inculturation; authority, revelation and discernment; scripture and culture; tradition; authority of personal experience; postmodernism: blessing or curse; formation for ministry; shape of future ministry; convenant; ecumenical relations; scriptural basis for ethical decision-making; sexuality; euthanasia; and biotechnology.

New Ways of Working focused on Preparing the Way priority "to provide services to dioceses - information, financial, and administrative." The goal was to allow members of General Synod to explore the effect of changes in communication, provision of services and relationships between the National Office and Dioceses. Topics for discussion included: care for church employees; information to serve your needs; sharing fairly and the Fair Share; website development; Anglican Journal editorial balance; Planned Giving; interim and part-time employees; Anglican Book Centre mandate and ministry; Anglican Appeal; and three year planning cycle. 

Following the forums members met in provincial caucuses to elect Council of General Synod members for the 1998-2001 triennium.
