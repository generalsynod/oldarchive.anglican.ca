    <strong><small>Leslie Lorensen watches the Canadian General Synod</small></strong></p>

    <p>&quot;Of the Anglican Communion provinces set along the Great Circle in the North

    Atlantic-- the British Isle churches, notably the Church of England, ECUSA and the

    Anglican Church of Canada-- it is the Canadian province that is pushing back the

    boundaries for living Christ's gospel of justice and peace. </p>

    <p>Reflecting the rich tapestry of Montreal's cultural mosaic, throughout the course of

    the meeting the mind of Synod consistently focuses on viable justice within its

    multifaceted communities within the province-- from the First Nations to the Maritimes--

    and in the wider global community especially with the provincial partners in Brazil. </p>

    <p>Seeking unity in diversity particular to Anglicanism, the heart of the discussion

    celebrates a multicultural vision that must serve as a model for the rest of the Anglican

    Communion and in building ecumenical relationships the wider faith community.</p>

    <p>Observing the synodical procedure on the floor of synod, it is not surprising that

    Canada offers a balanced view of synodical government. While the C of E &quot;Bishop in

    Synod&quot; model maintains top-down decision making power structure and ECUSA General

    Convention, while inverting this decision making model, separates the houses-- deputies in

    one room, bishops in another-- the fellowship in the Canadian synod is evidenced by common

    diocesan tables where laity, clergy and bishops consult and sit together as one body. Such

    a partnership model fosters healthy dialogue and, in keeping with the meeting's theme

    &quot;Lift Every Voice&quot;, ensures every voice the opportunity to be heard and heeded.

    Indeed, this is a loving model of pioneering church governance that other provinces in the

    post-Imperial Anglican Communion would do well to emulate. </p>

    <p>Truly, as Michael Peers, Primate of Canada stated in his mid-week sermon, the Canadian

    province of the world-wide Anglican Communion is inspired and working in the Holy

    Spirit.&quot;</td>
