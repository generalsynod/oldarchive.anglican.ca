    </div><p><em><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">&quot;Welcome to the 1998

    General Synod Anglican Olympics! </font></small></em></p>

    <p><em><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">We will start with an update

    from the water balloon baptism: Trudy Lebans whose patented &quot;Scatter shot&quot;

    method soaked 6 kids in one shot. A new Heavenly record.<br>

    <br>

    Moving on to Incense Polo- Team Catholic is beating the Uniteds 14 to 0. It seems that

    Team United forgot their thuribles.<br>

    <br>

    Archbishop Michael Peers has placed an appeal after his disqualification for illegal use

    of a crook during the Bishop's Race to trip Archbishop David Crawley.<br>

    <br>

    We will give you an update on the ABC Runabout as soon as we get the prices for you.<br>

    <br>

    There has been an official ruling that SuperSoakers will be allowed for distributing

    communion wine during the Eucharistic Sprint.<br>

    <br>

    We're into day 7 of the Biblical Marathon. Participants must match each other quote for

    quote, and several members are beginning to show signs of fatigue. Now that quotations

    from the Apocrypha have been deemed legal by the Assessors, there is no end in sight. We

    have word from the floor: they're beginning the New Testament round, and contestants are

    pacing themselves.<br>

    <br>

    The cathedrals have been disqualified from the Cruficix Javelin throw as the excessive

    ornamentation on their Cruficixes has been ruled illegal.<br>

    <br>

    High winds wreaked havoc with the wafer discus. There were wafers all over the ground, but

    the birds wouldn't eat them because even they don't believe the wafers are bread.<br>

    <br>

    This just in: the Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia is being tested for

    marijuana consumption after finishing dead last in the Speed Walk Recessional. Yet they

    were somehow the first ones at lunch.<br>

    <br>

    Dr. J. Daniels has disqualified all bishops from the Common Praise Press afer they tested

    positive for scotch consumption. Bishop Terry Finlay is being investigated for his role in

    scotch distribution. We expect high scores in the Common Praise Press as you can get an

    awful lot of not-yet-available books onto a barbell.<br>

    <br>

    We are looking forward to the 4 by 100 BCP relay later this week. The Prayerbook Society

    is expected to sweep this event after the Faith, Worship, and Ministry committee has

    announced that it is boycotting the event for lack of the word Huldah in the Eucharistic

    Prayer in the BCP.<br>

    <br>

    We look forward to bringing you updates from the 2001 General Synod Olympics in Waterloo.

    Until then, this is Simon and Stephe saying Keep on rowing.&quot;</font></small></em></td>
