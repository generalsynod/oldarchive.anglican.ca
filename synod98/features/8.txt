After nine days, more than 70,000 photocopies, and over 1,000 water bottles a day, the 35th General Synod closes this morning.  So too will our Internet coverage of the Synod.  It's been quite a priviledge to serve the church in this way, and I hope you've found value in the television and Internet coverage.

This email address will be closing down shorly.  If you'd like to reach me AFTER the synod, please use my personal email address: tmaffin@direct.ca.
If you have feedback for the information resources team at the national church office, please email Doug Tindal at dtindal@national.anglican.ca.
And following this weekend, the General Synod web site will be managed by Keith Nunn, interim web manager for the Anglican Church of Canada's web site.

On behalf of the entire news coverage team: Sam, Lorie, Joan, Doug, Lisa, Dana, and many others who helped, thanks so much for joining us.

WRAP-UP SUMMARY ON WEB SITE
The General Synod web site now has a final summary online of the major events of the past nine days.  It's a good at-a-glance recap if you want a quick view of what happened during these nine days in Montreal.  As well, the News Archive (see link at bottom of the main page) contains every single story we published on the web site.

SO THAT'S WHAT THE TUNE WAS FOR!
Yesterday's issue of Perspectives spoke about the TV crew pumping the music "Hot Hot Hot" through the closed-circuit television sets.  Now we know why.
 Turns out all week, the television cameras have been finding people falling asleep -- all footage captured was assembled overnight and presented to members this morning in a very funny retrospective of the "General Sauna."

PLEASE!  A HOTEL NEXT TIME!
Members this morning approved a motion to have the Council of General Synod consider shortening synod by three days and holding it in a hotel or convention centre.  Speaking to the motion, General Secretary Jim Boyles said he would support the motion because "this will give me something to do."  It costs about $500,000 to hold the General Synod, not including the $100,000 or so billed back to dioceses for the lodging and meals of their delegates.

THE BEST RESPONSE ON ANY VOTE
Members raised their hands quickly when one of the morning announcements from the General Secretary began: "Anyone who would like some money..." The notice turned out to have been about reimbursements for travel expenses.

TYPO OR POLITICAL STATEMENT?
Members were more than a little confused when one of the resolutions on the floor for debate made reference to the Uninvolved Nations.  The mention was owing from a typographical error -- it was supposed to have been the United Nations.

(Special collection of emails received in response to the proposed new Human Rights policy, which was approved by clergy and laity but defeated by bishops.)

"What an sad, embarrassing moment for the life of the church.  I'll be leaving the Anglican Church in search for spiritual nourishment elsewhere.
I can't stand for a church whose bishops don't permit the church to reflect the diversity in society.  The bishops should be ASHAMED of their behavior." -- Roger Kerr

"I praise God for the wise decision of our House of Bishops.I pray we might become more biblically centred listening not only to diverse voices within Canada and North America; but to our brothers and sisters overseas." -- Brian Kirby, Diocese of Edmonton

"It is very discouraging to see the leadership of clergy and laity on Human Rights not matched by that of the Bishops.  One must question how in touch the Bishops are with the society in which they serve." -- The Morrison family

"I thank God for the Bishops of the Church. My voice has been heard and I will not be disenfranchised.  I can remain an Anglican." -- Bruce Glencross

"Should I be sad or just furious?  I hope that we will be given a thorough explanation why the Bishops voted the way they did.  Was it brought down(the resolution) because of the sexual orientation clause or were there other reasons.  If it is an anti-gay vote this is a sad day for the Anglican Church of Canada. Where is God's love to be found in this.  I hope I am wrong."
-- Richard C. Gidney

Report from the Observing Partners

The Rev. Emmanuel Lapierre, Associate Director at the Canadian Centre for Ecumenism, spoke about the centre and the continuing dialogue between the Anglican  and Roman Catholic Churches. 

Richard Parkins, Director of Episcopal Migration Ministries, said that although he had only been at the Synod for 2 days, he was impressed with the extent of involvement and understanding he was able to achieve. He noted the leadership shown by the youth. He spoke with appreciation about the sharing of issues with all orders participating concurrently in deliberations and thanked the Synod for its action on the resolution re the Sudan, noting that it would be received with the greatest appreciation in that country. He also commented on the Synod's emphasis on global justice issues.  As new partner, he said that it is with a deeper sense of joy that he is a part of the Anglican Communion because of his experience with General Synod. 

The Rev. Randall Chase, who has been a partner to our Council of General Synod since 1995 when Preparing the Way was passed by Synod noted that the Anglican Church took a risk to "travel light" and this will be held up to other Anglican Churches as they look for new ways of working.  He said that he has heard many  voices in the debates at Synod and witnessed the struggles. 

Many members came thinking that the time of change was over. "My sense is that you need to put your seat belts on, you are in a time of transition that is about to draw you deeper, bring you closer to the heart of Christ.
I project that you are on the verge of going deeper in mission and ministry."  

Ran shared reflection on General Synod physical structure and agenda. It's time for a  Second Generation approach to First Nation issues and  to be open in the future to add more women to the House of Bishops and recognized the significant contribution of Church House staff. 

Ran thanked the Primate and all those that he has worked with over the past 4 years.
