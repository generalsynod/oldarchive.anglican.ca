rescind the legalization of the Rural Security Cooperatives, the CONVIVIR; and
to do all it can to support the efforts of the Colombian people to bring a just
end to the internal armed conflict; and to call on the Government of Canada to
adopt a coherent policy with respect to Colombia, placing demonstrated
improvements in the human rights situation at the centre of all its bilateral
relations. <p>

Burton Act and its continuing resistance to pressure to join the USA embargo

Constituent Assembly.  Failing that, the Reform Commission be set up to be a
forum representing the broad spectrum of Kenyan society, be independent both
financially and in its membership from President Moi and the ruling party; and,
the reform process must include the pressing issues of the executive powers of
the president, the independence of the judicial system, the use and

democratic practice in matters of free speech, freedom of assembly and equality
before the law; and respect for human rights and security of person.<p>

parties to the conflict in Sudan, but particularly by the Government of Sudan,
in view of overwhelming evidence of  indiscriminate violence against civilians
(particularly the aerial bombardment of civilians in southern and northeastern
Sudan and in the Nuba Mountains), the denial of humanitarian assistance to
civilian populations, incidents of chattel slavery, and the oppression of
women, and  3)  to request the General Secretary to call upon the Canadian
government and the United Nations to support actively efforts that will bring a
just peace for all peoples of the Sudan.  (A165)<p>

<b>4.	Partners Reflections</b><p>
In their reflections to Synod the partners expressed the importance of  having
Canadian partners and of being here to share the Synod with them. It is an
opportunity to see others at work and to learn from them.  The Bible study
groups have been particularly appreciated as a time to share the good news of
the Gospel.  Speaking about the diverse voices in the discussion on Human
Rights one of partners encouraged the Synod to "err on the side of love."<p>
<b><i>Afternoon</i></b><p>
This afternoon members attended the final forum of the General Synod - Diocese
to Diocese. The focus of the forum was <i>Preparing the Way </i>priority that
called for the elimination of program and resource production by the national
office, except when required to support the priorities of the <i>Preparing the
Way </i>strategic plan. The goal was to give members the opportunity to learn
from each other's strengths and struggles on those issues that affect dioceses
and parishes. <p>
Because of the nature of this forum, table groups were formed by diocesan
caucus. Topics for discussion included<i> </i>youth ministry; stewardship,
education and development; communication; adult education; fostering
evangelism; congregational development; fostering local outreach; supporting
clergy; multiculturalism; from maintenance to mission.<p>

<b>8.	Correction</b><p>
The following is a correction to the summary of the panel discussion that
appeared in the Daily Report, Tuesday, May 26, 1998. <p>
On the subject of diversity and identity, Anglican Archdeacon Rod Gillis of
Cape Breton in the diocese of Nova Scotia, said that as a spokesman from
Atlantic Canada, he could relate to the sense of fragility that people in many
part of Canada feel. This feeling is particularly acute in the Maritimes, he
noted, a part of the country where important sectors of society such as
resources, industry and the media tend to be under the control of firms based
in other parts of Canada.<p>
