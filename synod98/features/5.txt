It's beginning to catch up with us.  Partly from the heat on Plenary floor, partly the tiny beds and uncomfortable pillows.  On this Day 6 of the General Synod, more than a few people were walking slower today.

No long first word today as a result (it's only 10am and I'm already ready for a nap!), but an image from last night I thought I'd share.

At the end of the day, youth members and a few guests "made midnight entry" into the McGill Stadium (draw your own conclusions) and started an impromptu game of frisbee football.  Then, into the early hours, sang just about every camp/youth conference song ever written.  Because the stadium was closed at the time, the only lights were the orange glow of a nearby industrial floodlight, casting an eerie campfire-like glow on the members.

It was a nice way to end a busy day.

DON'T LOOK NOW, YOU'RE ON SYNOD CAMERA!
As a result of close votes, Synod members occasionally find themselves waiting for a few moments while the results of voting are tallied.  Lately, the four TV camera operators have been playing a fun game of "zoom in on someone who doesn't realize they're on the big screen and wait for them to do something embarassing."  Victim #1: the Suffragan Bishop of Toronto, Ann Tottenham, who was fanning her face to keep cool (not realizing she was on camera and had the entire Synod floor watching her) then proceeded to fan her underarms.  The Synod burst into laughter, and she turned bright red.

THE MEMBER FROM THE DIOCESE OF WHATEVER Chris Harwood-Jones, a clergy member from the diocese of Kootenay, was more than a little confused his first time at the microphone.  When he forgot to identify himself and his diocese, as all speakers are required to when they begin their comments, Harwood-Jones identified himself as being from "the diocese of whatever."

CHECK THE RECEIPTS OF ALL THOSE ANGLICANS!
Announcement read on the Plenary floor yesterday: "Contrary to what some members appear to have believed, the books on the display table of the Anglican Book Centre are not, in fact, free.  If you have taken some, please go back and settle up.  Thank you."

In his address to Synod on "Nation and Identity, the Rt. Rev. Andrew Hutchison, Bishop of Montreal said that his vision of the church in Quebec would see it stay out of partisan politics while pursuing goals of reconciliation, justice and peace. The address was an introduction to the evening session when a panel engaged the Synod in a discussion on the same topic.

Bishop Hutchison told the Synod that the church has no mandate to advocate one form of government over another. "How we choose to organize ourselves for collective security and well being is a political question that must be settled by voters at the ballot box, be they Christian or not, " he said.
But he added: "We do, on the other hand, have a mandate...to strive for justice and peace among all people and respect the dignity of every human being." 

"It is my view that the church has no business aligning itself with the Yes or No side of the referendum on such issues. It must, however, be vigilant in safeguarding the fundamental rights and well-being of its citizens. It is not acceptable to achieve a political agenda at the cost of the just and core values of a society." 

Bishop Hutchison admitted that as leader of an overwhelmingly anglophone diocese in a francophone province, his refusal to take political sides has at time been uncomfortable both for him and for members of the church who look to him for leadership.

On the other hand, he said he has not hesitated to speak passionately on political issues, both in private and in public, where he feels that questions of justice are involved.

He noted that he has spoken out on the question of native self-determination and on the removal of Passover foods from store shelves because they lacked French language packaging. "These are matters that for me touch our baptismal commitment," he explained. "Political organization, on the other hand, does not in such an obvious way."

Bishop Hutchison said that in the context of his views on church and politics, it  "is important to say that we do not intend to debate on the issue of the aspirations of Quebec or any group."

Rather, he added, it was important that General Synod members be exposed to an exchange of information, to the realization that concerns about the issues of nation and identity are common among many groups across the country and to the exploration of ways in which these diverse groups can help each other.

On the question of Quebec, however, Bishop Hutchison said it is a myth that Canada consists of "two solitudes." Politicians and others, he said, have been quick to exploit this myth of a nation based on a duality for their own purposes.

"It is a myth that does not take into account societies that have evolved clear across this land over thousands of years prior to European immigration. It takes no notice...of any countries other than France and Great Britain."  The myth as exploited by politicians "has effectively re-enforced a victim mentality among French Québecois, he said.

Rather than a nation of "two solitudes", Bishop Hutchison argued, Canada is, in fact, based on a notion of partnership, an area, he added, where the Anglican Church has a great deal to teach the rest of the country.

The Anglican concept of partnership, he said, consists of listening to others, understanding their aspirations and sharing resources required for them to achieve their dreams.

"I believe that the partnership principle that has become so respected internationally and in the affairs of our church in Canada could have a wider application within our land and serve us well in the future." Bishop Hutchison said.
