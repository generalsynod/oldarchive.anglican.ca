<b>7.	Nation and Identity (Part 1)</b><p>
In his address to Synod on "Nation and Identity, the Rt. Rev. Andrew Hutchison,
Bishop of Montreal said that his vision of the church in Quebec would see it
stay out of partisan politics while pursuing goals of reconciliation, justice
and peace. The address was an introduction to the evening session when a panel
engaged the Synod in a discussion on the same topic.<p>
Bishop Hutchison told the Synod that the church has no mandate to advocate one
form of government over another. "How we choose to organize ourselves for
collective security and well being is a political question that must be settled
by voters at the ballot box, be they Christian or not, " he said.  But he
added: "We do, on the other hand, have a mandate...to strive for justice and
peace among all people and respect the dignity of every human being." <p>
"It is my view that the church has no business aligning itself with the Yes or
No side of the referendum on such issues. It must, however, be vigilant in
safeguarding the fundamental rights and well-being of its citizens. It is not
acceptable to achieve a political agenda at the cost of the just and core
values of a society." <p>
Bishop Hutchison admitted that as leader of an overwhelmingly anglophone
diocese in a francophone province, his refusal to take political sides has at
time been uncomfortable both for him and for members of the church who look to
him for leadership.<p>
On the other hand, he said he has not hesitated to speak passionately on
political issues, both in private and in public, where he feels that questions
of justice are involved.<p>
He noted that he has spoken out on the question of native self-determination
and on the removal of Passover foods from store shelves because they lacked
French language packaging. "These are matters that for me touch our baptismal
commitment," he explained. "Political organization, on the other hand, does not
in such an obvious way."<p>
Bishop Hutchison said that in the context of his views on church and politics,
it  "is important to say that we do not intend to debate on the issue of the
aspirations of Quebec or any group."<p>
Rather, he added, it was important that General Synod members be exposed to an
exchange of information, to the realization that concerns about the issues of
nation and identity are common among many groups across the country and to the
exploration of ways in which these diverse groups can help each other.<p>
On the question of Quebec, however, Bishop Hutchison said it is a myth that
Canada consists of "two solitudes." Politicians and others, he said, have been
quick to exploit this myth of a nation based on a duality for their own
purposes.<p>
"It is a myth that does not take into account societies that have evolved clear
across this land over thousands of years prior to European immigration. It
takes no notice...of any countries other than France and Great Britain."  The
myth as exploited by politicians "has effectively re-enforced a victim
mentality among French Qu&eacute;becois, he said.<p>
Rather than a nation of "two solitudes", Bishop Hutchison argued, Canada is, in
fact, based on a notion of partnership, an area, he added, where the Anglican
Church has a great deal to teach the rest of the country.<p>
The Anglican concept of partnership, he said, consists of listening to others,
understanding their aspirations and sharing resources required for them to
achieve their dreams.<p>
"I believe that the partnership principle that has become so respected
internationally and in the affairs of our church in Canada could have a wider
application within our land and serve us well in the future." Bishop Hutchison
said.<p>

from their particular part of the country.  In the question and answer period
that  followed,  Mrs. Lizzie Epoo-York spoke about the North and  and the Innu
people she said "we pray for our leaders that you will make sound decisions- we
are down to earth proud to be Canadians."
