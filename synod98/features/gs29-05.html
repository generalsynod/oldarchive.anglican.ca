Deputy Prolocutor, Rendina Hamilton and Ben Arreak for their work in the past
triennium and presented them with gifts. The Primate also expressed his
appreciation.<p>
<b>6.	Closing Address </b>- <b>The Primate</b><p>
In his closing reflections the Primate distinguished between dividing on an
issue, and <i>being</i> divided.  In the parliamentary system, taking a vote is
called "dividing". We divide on every vote, including the vote on human rights,
but <i>being </i>divided is very different and we are not so. We are <u>not
</u> so.  Statements that we are so are not substantiated by this synod.<p>
 <p>
"My dear friends, I am so proud of you. I can go anywhere in the world and hold
up this flawed, imperfect  church with enormous pride."<p>
Archbishop Peers said this synod represented much work in progress. The synod
that meets in Kitchener Waterloo in 2001 will pick up on work done here related
to issues of worship, closer relations with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Canada, and further work on evangelism and matters of revisions of the Book of
Common Prayer and Book of Alternative Services. "I have seen this Synod as a
time to pick up Paul's image writing to the church in Corinth. We plant, we
water, but it is God who brings the increase. We have done our work well and we
want to see those things blossom and flourish. The extent that there is
increase in this synod from now on is in the hands of God."<p>
The Primate declared that the 35th Session of the General Synod of the Anglican
Church of Canada closed.
