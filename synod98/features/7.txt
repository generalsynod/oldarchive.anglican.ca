<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>LATE-BREAKING: NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP CONFIRMED

Members have approved membership of the 1998-2001 national committees. 
You can find the story and complete list on the web site. 


</fontfamily>REFLECTIONS ONLINE

Two new features on the web site at https://www.anglican.ca/synod98/  The first is the second in our series following first-time member Paul Feheley from the Diocese of Ottawa.  And second, Leslie Lorenson, who has attended a number of Anglican synods around the world, shares with you her perspective on how the Anglican Church of Canada differs and what we have in common.


LICENCING CANON/ALTERNATIVE SERVICES TEXT

The complete text of the approved Licencing Canon and the alternative prayers and services will be posted on the www.anglican.ca web site next week.  The delay is not intentional -- synod staff are backlogged by amendments and last-minute resolutions, and want to be certain the text is accurate when released.  Thanks for your patience.


TV SHOW LINEUP TONIGHT

Don't forget to tune into Vision TV tonight at 7pm (Eastern/Pacific) for continuing coverage of the General Synod.  Among the highlights on tonight's show: a look at a refugee ministry in the Diocese of Montreal, an interview with New Westminster bishop Michael Ingham on his controversial "Mansions of the Spirit", and a focus on the Synod's partner observers.


<fontfamily><param>Arial</param>PLEASE.  A COMFY PILLOW.  PLEEEEASE!

Members will note later today on a members' resolution to investigate the feasibility of holding the General Synod in a convention centre or hotel and reducing its length from nine days to 6 or 7 days.  This morning, synod started with a humourous video showing General Synod Coordinator Jamie Tomlinson complaining about the "roughing it" accommodations -- from a luxury hotel in a terrycloth robe with a masseusse on standby.


JUST IN CASE YOU FORGOT PLENARY WAS HOT...

Staff in the TV production truck claim it was just "what happened to be in the CD player at the time."  But during a break, members on the floor of Plenary and those of us watching the closed-circuit feed were a bit suspicious when the song "Hot Hot Hot" was played more than a few times. 
No retaliatory strike has been announced.


DEBATE OR DIALOGUE?

An interesting moment on the floor of Synod yesterday.  Members seem to be getting weary of spending time in forums and dialogue sessions, and appear to want to get their hands into more of the resolutions, many of which are stacking up.  One member this morning rose to make the unusual request to cancel this afternoon's Diocese-to-Diocese forum and replace it with time for more resolutions.  The request was narrowly defeated by a vote.  Then, a motion to start the afternoon session an hour earlier to get more time for resolutions was defeated by the order of bishops, though the majority of house was in favour.


THE DANA SIBLEY COUNT

For those of you playing along at home, Dana Sibley has been seen on the TV program zero times thus far.  (In-joke.)

In their reflections to Synod yesterday, the partners expressed the importance of  having Canadian partners and of being here to share the Synod with them. It is an opportunity to see others at work and to learn from them.  The Bible study groups have been particularly appreciated as a time to share the good news of the Gospel.  Speaking about the diverse voices in the discussion on Human Rights one of the partners encouraged the Synod to "err on the side of love."


In the afternoon, members attended the final forum of the General Synod - Diocese to Diocese. The focus of the forum was Preparing the Way priority that called for the elimination of program and resource production by the national office, except when required to support the priorities of the Preparing the Way strategic plan. The goal was to give members the opportunity to learn from each other's strengths and struggles on those issues that affect dioceses and parishes. 


Because of the nature of this forum, table groups were formed by diocesan caucus. Topics for discussion included youth ministry; stewardship, education and development; communication; adult education; fostering evangelism; congregational development; fostering local outreach; supporting clergy; multiculturalism; from maintenance to mission.

Gregory Benton of Trinity College School in Port Hope writes: "In memory of a dear friend and bishop, the late Archbishop of Toronto, Lewis Garnsworthy, some members may recall him saying the following while presiding over diocesan synod: "I hate Synod.  Why don't we all go home and get some work done!"
