        </div><p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small>&quot;It's information

        overload,&quot; he chuckled.&nbsp; &quot;But it's incredibly exciting.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, Paul is finding value in just being with other

        Anglicans.&nbsp; &quot;I've had limited exposure to people outside of Toronto for national

        events, and suddenly here you could be having breakfast with a bishop in B.C., lunch with

        a farmer from Brandon, and so on.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's good to know that we're all members of a common

        church when we're here -- not 'You're a delegate from X Diocese'; we're all members of the

        same General Synod.&nbsp; And that's very encouraging.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yes, there are a lot of faults in the church, but

        here's a place where we can all listen and be one.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Synod theme of <em>Lift Every Voice</em> guiding

        his thoughts, Paul thinks <em>listening to</em> every voice is just as important. &nbsp;

        &quot;I'm not going to agree with all those voices, but I look forward to listening to

        them.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul believes it's more of a challenge these days to

        really listen to each other. &nbsp; &quot;People want to know where you stand now,&quot;

        he explained. &nbsp; &quot;There are more shades of grey and I don't think you can stand

        in the middle any more.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Synod business hasn't started yet, Paul says

        he already feels his horizons have broadened.&nbsp; And he's anxious to &quot;get into the

        resolutions and get things into action.&quot;</small></font></p>

        <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><strong>Day Six, May 26<br>

        </strong><small>For anyone else, it would be a lousy way to spend a 20th wedding

        anniversary.&nbsp; But for Paul Feheley and his wife who is back home in Oshawa, it makes

        perfect sense.</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing the work of the church is a passion for both

        Paul and his &quot;very understanding&quot; spouse.&nbsp; As he reflects on the Synod at

        the half-way way mark (&quot;95% to 99% of which I'm actually enjoying&quot;), Paul says

        he's exhausted but excited to be learning a lot.</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's like the end of a good worship

        service,&quot; he explains.&nbsp; &quot;You're spiritually drained but excited because

        you've done what God has asked you to do.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so far, Synod hasn't held as many surprises as he

        thought it would.&nbsp; The tone of debate, for example, he is glad to be finding

        refreshingly respectful.&nbsp; So far, Paul has only spoken at the mike once. &nbsp; But

        he is finding more value in the discussions, not necessarily the formal debate.</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I've used the forums mostly to learn more

        about the wider church.&nbsp; For instance, I attended the forum on Northern Ministry

        which is something I didn't know a lot about. . . . And learning these new skills and ways

        of listening to people from different cultures is important.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing Paul says he's valued was time spent getting to

        know people from his <em>own </em>diocese better.&nbsp; &quot;I see these people from time

        to time in the diocese, but being able to spend so much time learning and sharing with

        them has been very helpful.&nbsp; At our table, nobody wears clerical dress, so we all

        come together in a community and harmonious way.&quot;</small><br>

        <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul was looking forward to the evening off, which he was

        to spend with his diocece</small> <small>having dinner and visiting the open house at a

        nearby Convent.</small></font></td>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is at General Synod &quot;to learn more about how other

        Canadian Anglicans think and understand our Church. As with perhaps most people I love our

        Church but worry about its future direction and the danger of division.&quot;<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev. Canon Feheley has been ordained for twenty years and has

        been active in the leadership of his diocese.<br>
