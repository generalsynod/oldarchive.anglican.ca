A spectacular opening service last night at the Montreal Cathedral.  We have a photographic feature now online at the General Synod web site at http://www.anglican.ca/synod98/

And I'm also pleased to say that, after a few loooooong hours late last night, there is also a two-minute AUDIO sampling of the opening service as well!  You'll need a RealAudio player to hear it.  You'll find it on the web site too.

In a few moments, you'll receive a news release summarizing the opening address by Archbishop Michael Peers, scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST this morning.  You'll also receive the complete text of the address.  Both will also be available on the web site at the same time.

Later today, I'll send a news release about last night's opening sermon by the Right Rev. French Chang-Him.

WEB SITE GARNERING THOUSANDS OF HITS
The Anglican Church of Canada has recorded 8,000 "hits" (transfers of files) since March of this year.  Five thousand of those have been in the last three weeks.

LITURGICAL STAMPEDE?
I had just found the perfect place to shoot my photos for the web coverage of the Opening Service -- crouched in the middle of a narrow aisle -- when I happened to glance down the aisle.  There, looking panicked, was one of the young liturgical dancers, clearly trying to silently shoo me out of the way before her cue.  The next instant, her cue hit and she came sprinting down the aisle directly at me!  With all the seats full, I had no choice but to run, still crouching, at top speed to reach the end of the aisle.
It must have been quite the sight to see a liturgical dancer chasing a frightened photographer!

OUR NEWBIE SURVIVES DAY ONE
Paul Feheley is on information overload, but is excited about the next few days.  Paul, a priest in Oshawa, has agreed to let us follow him around and peer into his thoughts as a first-time member.  You can read his Day One diary on the web site at 
http://www.anglican.ca/synod98/features/newbie.html

WEB SITE CHOCK FULL O' STUFF
While you're reading about Paul's first day, be sure to poke around the rest of the site.  Recent additions yesterday included a Day One photo album, a feature on the youth caucus, and expanded coverage of the behind-the-scenes action.

YOUR DISPATCHES ARE BEING READ
Thanks to those of you who sent messages to the floor of Plenary -- your messages are being collected, printed, and posted on the Dispatches from the Internet board several times each day.  If YOU want to lift your own voice, email owner-acc-synodnews@anglican.ca and put the word "dispatches" in the subject line.  This is intended for messages to all members as a whole; it is not a message service for individual members.

The vestments worn by the Primate at last night's opening service were commissioned because the primatial cope and mitre, given some decades ago by the Nippeon Sei Ko Kai, are now so fragile that they can be used only on rare occasions.  The vestments were designed by Betty McLeod, artist in residence of St Paul's Cathedral, London Ontario.  You can see a photo of Abp. Peers wearing these vestments at last night's service by pointing your web browser to: http://www.anglican.ca/synod98/features/open_stole.jpg

Is it a joke if it's true? My favourite malapropisms from readers at the Eucharist.
In an urban parish: "I am alfalfa and omega . . ."  at Harvest Festival!
In a rural parish: "We'll read the psalm by the half verse, breaking at the hysterics."
And how can Anglicans sing the last line of verse 1 of How Firm a Foundation to St.Denio and not crack a smile as they sing Yoo-hoo to Jesus?
-- Contributed by Dorothy Crocker

(Tell us YOUR favourite Anglican joke!  Email owner-acc-synodnews@anglican.ca and put the word "snickering" in the subject line.)
