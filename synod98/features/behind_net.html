    extensive coverage on the Internet.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic News Coordinator Tod Maffin had a palmtop

    computer, notebook computer, digital camera, and audio recorder with him at all times to

    record information. &nbsp;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This information was transmitted by wireless signal to the host

    system in the newsroom where it was instantly published on the web site, the <a

    href="../newslist.html">Synod98 Direct</a> newswire, or both.<br>

    </font><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was also responsible for editing the nightly <em>Perspectives

    </em>interactive Synod newsletter.</small><br>

    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was Maffin's third General Synod; the previous two

    (1995 and 1992) he attended as a youth member for his diocese, during which time he

    published a <a href="https://www.anglican.org/online/canada/gensynod/todstory.htm">daily

    unofficial electronic newsletter</a> on the happenings of General Synod.</small><br>

    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a member of the national Information Resources

    Committee and founder of <em><a href="https://www.anglican.org/online/" target="_blank">Anglicans

    Online</a></em>, the world's largest Anglican web site.</small></font></td>
