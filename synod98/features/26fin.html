<b><i>Monday Evening Panel Discussion</i></b><p>
The following is a summary  of the panel discussion, Monday evening, <p>
May 25.<p>
A panel of public figures told Synod that church leaders ought to play a
greater role in speaking out on issues of the day, especially when matters of
principle and social justice are concerned.<p>
The strongest plea for a more pro-active social role by the church and its
leaders came from Quebec elder statesman Claude Ryan, a former Liberal leader
in the Assembl&eacute;e Nationale and the spokesman for the No side during
Quebec's first referendum on independence in 1980.<p>
"I would like to see religious leaders intervene in debates more clearly and
more forcibly where matters of principle are involved," Mr. Ryan told the 300
General Synod members meeting here this week. "I would like to see them
participate more in the formation of young people...The Church must play a more
active role in helping us solve our problems"<p>
His comments were echoed by Senator Ann Cools, moderator of the five-person
panel, who agreed that the church "must intervene more forcibly in the problems
of  our country," and by former attorney general  of British Columbia, Brian
Smith, who described churches as "important vehicles of national understanding
and reconciliation."<p>
Another panelist, Joan Fraser, Director General of the Centre for Research and
Information on Canada and a former editor of the Montreal Gazette, asked: "If
you the church, don't go to the heart of things, then who will?"<p>
The panel was convened to address Synod members on the theme of "nation and
identity" but comments covered the gamut of social and political issues with
the place of Quebec in the Canadian Confederation at the forefront.<p>
The General Synod theme -- "Lift every voice/Faisons entendre nos voix"  is
meant to invite members to reflection diversity, inclusiveness and minority
voices in Canadian society.<p>
Another panelist, Grand Chief Matthew Coon-Come of the Grand Council of the
Cree, said that churches today are to be commended for the role they seek to
play in righting social wrongs, but that in the past, they have been complicit
in fostering social conditions that have lead to the plight of aboriginal
peoples in Canada today. "I challenge members of all faith communities to be
witness to these injustices," he said, referring to the social problems his
people struggle against.<p>
Speaking to the evening's theme, Chief Coon-Come said that "nation and
identity" are  more  than mere political concepts. In the case of Canada's
aboriginal peoples, he argued, "it is self evident that we are a people and a
nation."<p>
Chief Coon-Come said there has, in fact, been little evolution in the way that
Canadian society treats aboriginal peoples from the days of imposed or
fraudulent treaties today. A new policy to deal with aboriginal peoples
formulated by the Quebec government is a perpetuation of the same "fraud and
hoax," he said. <p>

<b><i>Tuesday morning</i></b><p>
The morning session began with a humorous <i>Even TV Hosts are Human.</i><p>
The Venn. Jim Boyles, General Secretary of General Synod,  announced that the
Rt. Rev. Jim Cruickshank, Bishop of Cariboo,  had left the Synod to attend a
trial in Smithers, B.C. involving the Diocese of  Cariboo and the General Synod
of the Anglican Church of Canada. Archdeacon Boyles asked members to pray for
all those involved in the trial which is expected to take approximately two
weeks.<p>
<b>1.	Primate's Commission on Evangelism</b><p>
The Rev. Maude Parsons-Horst spoke on behalf of the Primate's Commission on
Evangelism. She said that the Primate has raised the voice of evangelism, not
only in Canada, but throughout the world as he travels on behalf of the
Anglican Communion. Anglicans have been silent (about evangelism) for a while
and it is hard to find your voice when you have been silent for a long time but
there are now encouraging signs across the country that the church is
awakening. <p>
Synod viewed a video of the April meeting of the Primate's Commission on
Evangelism. <p>
The Rt. Rev. Peter Mason, Bishop of Ontario and a member of the Primate's
Commission on Evangelism chaired a panel discussion on evangelism. Panel
members were: <p>
Ms. Anne Marie Beedle  (Huron)<p>
The Rev. Timothy Chesterton  (Athabasca)<p>
The Rt. Rev. Don Harvey  (East. NF &amp; Lab.)<p>
Each panelist spoke about how they experience evangelism in their lives today
and offered their vision of evangelism - people across the country in parishes
coming to know the real love of God; small loving communities where people feel
affirmed and can grow in love; changing the way we think about evangelism -
involving doubting, seeking people in community and sharing the gospel.<p>
Bishop Mason thanked the Primate for his leadership and said that he has opened
the door and kept it open -  I hope that the decade of evangelism will stretch
out to be the millennium of evangelism.<p>
In his closing remarks the Primate spoke about the document <i>The Inviting
Church</i>, a document on evangelism that was presented to the 1980 General
Synod and said that it was a defining moment for evangelism in the church.<p>
The Primate's Commission on Evangelism was established  in (1989). The
Commission will continue to work toward the end of the decade and will have
another gathering before then.<p>
<b>2.	Human Rights</b><p>
Prior to the resolution on Human Rights Dr. Chris Lind explained to the Synod
the history of the proposal that began the Human Rights process in the Church.
<p>
The Covenant of Protection that The Anglican Church of Canada proposes to enter
into with its members, with its employees, and with those who seek the services
of the church, in order to protect those most vulnerable includes the right
to:<p>
<b><i>1.	</i></b>be treated  with courtesy, compassion and integrity<p>
<b><i>2.	</i></b>fair treatment<p>
<b><i>3.	</i></b>to vote<p>
<b><i>4.	</i></b>be considered for election<p>
<b><i>5.	</i></b>be considered for service<p>
<b><i>6.	</i></b>and the proposal outlines the rights of all persons employed
by the church in positions not requiring ordination.<p>
Synod met in committee of the whole to discuss Human Rights  resolutions A130R
and  C-20.<p>

and Grace Delaney from the Council of Indigenous peoples addressed the Synod
and made a presentation, of  the Hendry Report - <i>Beyond Traplines,</i> to
the Primate, Bishop Hutchison and Bishop Beardy.  The presentation was in
honour of the re-issue of the book in an up-dated version. The book is
available from the Anglican Book Centre.<p>
Many groups of indigenous people are represented in Anglican Church of Canada
"they are spread across this land from the very edge of Labrador to the high
Arctic and across the mountains to British Columbia." They are known by many
names - Gitskan, Nisga'a, Swampy Cree, Quebec Cree...<p>
The Rev. Arthur Anderson, Ms. Jennifer Pepabano and Mrs. Lizzie Epoo-York
shared their personal stories.<p>
The  Indigenous People in the Anglican Church of Canada have begun to heal the
pain of their experiences at residential schools . The healing began at the 1st
Native Convocation in 1993 with the Primate's apology for the   the physical,
cultural and emotional abuse that took place in some of the  residential
schools. The healing continues.<p>
Grace Delaney thanked the national church for its support on their journey,
especially Anglican Video, the Primate's World Relief and Development Fund and
the Anglican Foundation.  She also expressed appreciation to the New England
Company for its financial support.  <p>
Members viewed <i>A Journey Begins with a Dream,</i> produced by Anglican
Video, documenting the healing journey of the indigenous people of the Anglican
Church of Canada.<p>
