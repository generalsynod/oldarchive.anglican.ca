    Montreal Andrew Hutchison has given members of the church's chief governing body a vision

    of the church in Quebec that would see it stay out of partisan politics while pursuing

    goals of reconciliation, justice and peace.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking on the theme of &quot;nation and identity,&quot; Bishop

    Hutchison told 300 members of the Anglican General Synod meeting here this week that the

    church has no mandate to advocate one form of government over another.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How we choose to organize ourselves for collective security and

    well being is a political question that must be settled by voters at the ballot box, be

    they Christian or not,&quot; he said.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bishop added: &quot;We do, on the other hand, have a mandate

    ... to strive for justice and peace among all people and respect the dignity of every

    human being.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is my view that the church has no business aligning itself

    with the Yes or the No side of a referendum on such issues. It must, however, be vigilant

    in safeguarding the fundamental rights and well being of its citizens. It is not

    acceptable to achieve a political agenda at the cost of the just and core values of a

    society.&quot;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Hutchison admitted that as leader of an overwhelmingly

    anglophone diocese in a francophone province, his refusal to take political sides has at

    times been uncomfortable both for him and for members of the church who look to him for

    leadership.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, he said he has not hesitated to speak passionately

    on political issues, both in private and in public, where he feels that questions of

    justice are involved.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He noted that he has spoken out on the question of native

    self-determination and on the removal of Passover foods from store shelves because they

    lacked French language packaging. &quot;These are matters that for me touch our baptismal

    commitment,&quot; he explained. &quot;Political organization, on the other hand, does not

    in such an obvious way.&quot;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bishop Hutchison's address was an introduction to a session later in

    the day in which an invited panel was to engage General Synod in a discussion on

    &quot;nation and identity.&quot; The bishop told the gathering that in the context of his

    views on church and politics, it &quot;is important to say that we do not intend a debate

    on the issue of the aspirations of Quebec or any group.&quot;<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather, he added, it was important that General Synod members be

    exposed to an exchange of information, to the realization that concerns about issue of

    nation and identity are common among many groups across the country and to the exploration

    of ways in which these diverse groups can help each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of Quebec, however, Bishop Hutchison said it is a myth

    that Canada consists of &quot;two solitudes.&quot; Politicians and others, he said, have

    been quick to exploit this myth of a nation based on a duality for their own purposes.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It is a myth that does not take into account societies that have

    evolved clear across this land over thousands of years prior to European immigration. It

    takes no notice ... of any countries other than France and Great Britain.&quot; The myth

    as exploited by politicians &quot;has effectively re-enforced a victim mentality among

    French Québecois,&quot; he said.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than a nation of two solitudes, Bishop Hutchison argued, Canada

    is, in fact, based on a notion of partnership, an area, he added, where the Anglican

    church has a great deal to teach the rest of the country.<br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Anglican concept of partnership, he said, consists of listening to

    others, understanding their aspirations and sharing resources required for them to achieve

    their dreams. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I believe that the partnership principle that has become so

    respected internationally and in the affairs of our church in Canada could have a wider

    application within our land and serve us well in the future,&quot; Bishop Hutchison said.<br>
