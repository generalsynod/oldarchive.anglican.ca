    face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">MONTREAL (May 22) -- Archbishop Michael Peers,

    Primate of Canada, has urged more than 300 members of the church&#146;s chief governing

    body to give greater heed to minority voices in society, including Canada&#146;s

    francophone population, members of indigenous communities and those marginalized because

    of gender, sexuality or age. </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In an opening address to the

    church&#146;s General Synod meeting here for nine days, Archbishop Peers, spiritual head

    of Canada&#146;s 750,000 Anglicans, also called on church members to address issues such

    as the impact of globalization and multinational trade agreements, international and

    third-world debt, and the widening gulf between the world&#146;s rich and poor. </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Drawing of the Biblical vision of

    the &quot;Jubilee&quot; year, in which debts were to be forgiven and wealth redistributed,

    Archbishop Peers said he hoped the idea of debt cancellation for some of the world&#146;s

    poorest nations could be explored to mark the millenium.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">General Synod meets every three

    years, drawing members from across each of the country&#146;s 30 Anglican dioceses, to

    discuss issues relating to church and society.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In his address, Archbishop Peers

    also spoke of the on-going conversations with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada

    and expressed the hope that deliberations here would lead to acceptance of full-communion

    between the two churches by the next time synod meets in the year 2001.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">(&quot;Full communion&quot; is not a

    merger of the two churches, but means that they recognize each other&#146;s rites,

    services and clerical orders.)</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">&quot;Lutherans and Anglicans have

    come to a point in which there is a friendship that holds the promise of genuine

    partnership,&quot; Archbishop Peers told synod members.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Archbishop Peers linked the theme of

    General Synod -- &quot;Lift every voice -- Faisons entendre nos voix&quot; -- to a theme

    of &quot;connectedness.&quot; He noted that it has been 39 years since General Synod last

    met in Montreal. &quot;The voice least heard in our midst is that of Quebec and

    francophone Canada,&quot; he said. &quot;I suggest that for many in this assembly, the

    discipline of listening with care to that voice will be among our most serious

    challenges.&quot;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">He also referred to matters such as

    social and justice issues and the cancellation of third-world debt, issues that are also

    likely to occupy more than 800 Anglican bishops from around the world when they meet in

    England at the Lambeth Conference later this summer.. </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In all their deliberations and

    debates in the next nine days, Archbishop Peers told members to avoid becoming as

    &quot;those whose world is so far removed from the realities of most citizens of this

    planet that they cannot see or do not care about what happens to those whose lives they

    affect.&quot;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Among other tasks facing General

    Synod members, Archbishop Peers noted, is evaluating progress made since the last

    gathering in Ottawa in 1995, where the church decided to shift priorities at the national

    level away from domestic work in favor of developing and nurturing overseas partnerships </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Members are also expected to

    address:</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">* Issues relating to euthanasia and

    assisted suicide;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">* Issues related to cloning and

    reproductive technologies;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">* The place of indigenous peoples in

    the Anglicafn Church of Canada;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">* How Anglicans effectively relate

    to each other in an increasingly complex and diverse society;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">* Issues relating to human rights

    and</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">* Church legislation dealing with

    the authority of bishops over priests.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Members will also meet in a number

    of forums addressing topics such as the church&#146;s relationships with overseas

    partners, relations with other faiths and denominations, social justice issues and

    relations between the 30 dioceses and the national church.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The Anglican Church of Canada is the

    country&#146;s third largest Christian denomination.</font></small></p>
