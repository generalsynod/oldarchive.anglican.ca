    <small><small>MONTREAL -- (May 22, 1998)</small></small><br>

    Canadians must address the urgent question of cultural identity, Bishop French Chang-Him

    told about 800 Anglican General Synod members and visitors at Montreal's Christ Church

    Cathedral Thursday evening. </small></font></p>

    service marked the opening of the Anglican Church of Canada's 35th General Synod, which

    meets every three years to discuss issues relating to church and society.</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small>Bishop Chang-Him of Seychelles, who

    is attending the Synod as an overseas partner, told the congregation that Canada's future

    depends on its ability to hear and understand the diverse voices of its population.</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small>&quot;Canada has become very

    cosmopolitan since I first visited in 1986,&quot; he said. &quot;On a 1991 visit I

    preached a sermon that had to be translated into Cantonese so I could be understood. This

    was not in Hong Kong or Singapore, but in downtown Toronto.&quot; </small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small>Bishop Chang-Him told the

    congregation that Canada must work hard to promote increased cooperation and appreciation

    between people of different backgrounds. Drawing on the Anglican General Synod theme

    &quot;Lift Every Voice/Faisons Entendre Nos Voix&quot; he asked: &quot;When you lift the

    many voices of this country, will it be a rich harmony or a disturbing, competing

    cacophany?&quot;</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small>Bishop Chang-Him shared his personal

    struggle to find peace with his cultural identity. &quot;Coming from a background that

    included African, French and Asian roots I felt a pain inside of not knowing who I

    was,&quot; he said. He urged all Canadians to affirm the rich diversity of their citizens

    and to listen carefully to those who are not in the mainstream of society.</small></font></p>

    <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small>Among the discussions scheduled

    during the nine-day Anglican synod is a forum on nation and identity. The synod incudes

    bishops, clergy and lay representatives from 30 dioceses across Canada.</small></font></td>
