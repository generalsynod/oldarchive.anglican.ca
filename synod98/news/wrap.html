    of diversity, as nine-day meeting wraps up</font></big></p>

    </b><p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><small><small>MONTREAL (May 29, 1998) </small></small><br>

    <small>In a nine-day meeting here, the Anglican Church of Canada&#146;s chief governing

    body approved legislation bringing the church closer to Lutherans, opposing euthanasia and

    cloning, and expressing the church&#146;s support to partner churches in several oppressed

    or war-torn countries.</small></font></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The church also approved motions

    asking for government action on several social policy issues.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In the first meeting it has held in

    Montreal in 30 years, the 300-member General Synod also spent a considerable amount of

    time reflecting on &quot;nation and identity&quot; and on what it means to be a minority

    voice in a society as diverse as Canada&#146;s.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The theme of this General Synod, a

    body which meets every three years in a different part of the country, was &quot;Lift

    every voice -- Faisons entendre nos voix&quot; which was meant to help members focus on

    those who are often ignored or unheard.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In his opening address at the start

    of synod, Archbishop Michael Peers, the primate, set the tone when he told delegates that

    one of the least heard voices in the Canadian Anglican church was that of French Canada.

    He challenged synod members to pay particular attention to that voice during the

    gathering.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Synod members spent a whole evening

    listening to panel members representing different voices or geographical parts of the

    country speak about what it means to be a part of the Canadian whole. </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Synod members also heard a

    presentation from the church&#146;s indigenous members, a group that is working to

    implement a &quot;Native Covenant&quot; which would give it greater autonomy within the

    church.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Host bishop Andrew Hutchison of

    Montreal delivered a major address in which he expressed the difficulties involved in

    leading a church that represents a very small number of Anglophones in an overwhelmingly

    Francophone province. </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In his speech, Bishop Hutchison also

    argued that while the church has no mandate to play a role in partisan politics, it is

    bound by conscience to take strong positions on matters involving principles such as

    peace, justice and reconciliation.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Synod members took him to heart,

    passing more than a dozen resolutions affirming the Canadian church&#146;s stand against

    oppression, injustice, violence and war in several parts of the world.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Through some of these resolutions,

    the Canadian Anglican church offered expressions of solidarity to partner churches and the

    people of Kenya, Sudan and Columbia who suffer from war or political oppression. Members

    voted to ask Ottawa to play a greater mediation role between Cuba and the United States.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Meeting the week that Pakistan

    exploded a number of nuclear devices in response to similar tests carried out by India,

    synod delegates called on the Canadian government to renounce the use of nuclear weapons

    and to exert pressure on other governments to do so as well.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">They voted to ask the church&#146;s

    ecojustice committee to produce resources to enable Canadian congregations &quot;to study

    the Just War theory and its implications for Christian response to war and

    militarism.&quot;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Members also called on the federal

    government to initiate a broad process of public consultation whenever it negotiates

    multilateral agreements on investment and trade and to consider the implications of such

    pacts, especially on the most disadvantaged members of society such as the elderly, the

    very young and indigenous peoples.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Members also voted to ask the Prime

    Minister to apologize to Inuit people displaced from traditional hunting areas on the east

    coast of Hudson Bay and Baffin Island to the High Arctic in the 1950s;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">In the area of social policy,

    General Synod approved resolution saying it cannot support euthanasia and assisted

    suicide. The resolution described such measures as &quot;a failure of human

    community.&quot;</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The church also called on Ottawa to

    prohibit the cloning of human beings.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The resolution with what may have

    the broadest impact for the Anglican community itself, was one commending for study a

    report urging &quot;full communion&quot; between Canadian Anglicans and the Evangelical

    Lutheran Church in Canada.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Full communion would not be an

    actual merger of the two churches, but means that each would recognize the other&#146;s

    clergy, rites and sacraments. It could lead to extensive sharing of resources and even

    personnel between the two denominations. Reactions to that report will be gathered by both

    churches in the next three years and considered again when their respective governing

    bodies next meet in the year 2001.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">One of the most arduous parts of the

    proceedings, held in a sweltering gymnasium at McGill University, was a debate on

    &quot;human rights principles&quot; for church members and employees that would have

    legislated protection from discrimination on the basis of age, sex, sexual orientation,

    family or marital status, race, colour, ethnic origin, ancestry, disability, creed and

    socio-economic status.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The often emotional debate on that

    resolution stretched over three days and the proposal was ultimately narrowly defeated

    after synod members failed to agree on a way to marry theological concerns to language

    more commonly associated with civil courts proceedings.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">General Synod, which consists of

    bishops, clergy and lay people elected to the task in each of the church&#146;s 30

    dioceses, meets every three years.</font></small></p>
