<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.&#9;Standards of Sexual Conduct</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the General Synod proceed cautiously in considering standards of sexual conduct in the church and give strong ear to the following statement, being Statement #14 of the Standards of Sexual Conduct in the Montreal Declaration of Anglican Essentials:</P>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;God designed human sexuality not only for procreation but also for the joyful expression of love, honour and fidelity between wife and husband.  These are the only sexual relations that biblical theology deems good and holy.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adultery, fornication and homosexual unions are intimacies contrary to God’s design.  The church must seek to minister healing and wholeness to those who are sexually scarred, or who struggle with ongoing sexual temptations, as most people do.  Homophobia and all forms of sexual hypocrisy and abuse are evils against which Christians must ever be on their guard.  The church may not lower God’s standards of sexual morality for any of its members, but must honour God by upholding these standards tenaciously in face of society’s departure from them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Congregations must seek to meet the particular needs for friendship and community that single persons have.&quot;</P>
