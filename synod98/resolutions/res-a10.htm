<B><P>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</P>

</B><P>&quot;Religious Communities&quot; as defined by the House of Bishops, are a group of baptized Christians in the Anglican Church of Canada who are not represented in General Synod because their communal life compels them to be outside the normal parish structure of the Church.  While some dioceses allow a representative of religious communities resident in their dioceses to be appointed a member of a diocesan synod, dioceses usually elect to General Synod those members of their own synods who have been elected by the parishes.</P>

<P>The definition of these &quot;religious communities&quot; is in the Terms of Reference of the House of Bishops’ Standing Committee on religious Communities:</P>

<I><P>&quot;Religious Communities of the Anglican Church of Canada are Christian communities in communion with the See of Canterbury. The members make vows to hold property in common, to live in celibate chastity, and obedience to the Statutes and Constitution of the particular community. Further, the members are of the same sex, live in a common life under the Rule of the Order and undertake to say the Divine Office following a regular, daily pattern.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>There are currently resident in Canada three communities that qualify under the House of Bishops’ definition: the Order of the Holy Cross; the Community of the Sisters of the Church; and </P>
<P>the Sisterhood of St. John the Divine.  In addition, the Society of St. John the Evangelist, Cambridge, Massachusetts, still has a Canadian corporation; if they once again open a Canadian house, they will make the fourth &quot;Religious Community&quot; in Canada according to the House of Bishops’ definition.</P>

<P>The matter of representation of religious orders in the General Synod was considered by the former Organization Committee at the request of the House of Bishops Standing Committee on Religious Orders.  The Organization Committee met with representatives of the orders.  Both the committee and the National Executive Council recommended the proposed amendment to General Synod in 1995, when it was adopted on First Reading.</P>
