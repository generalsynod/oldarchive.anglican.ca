</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Canadian projects have always been part of the Primate’s Fund, benefitting disaster victims, poverty self-help groups through PLURA (an inter-church coalition) and First Nations through land claims advocacy, and economic development projects.  However, the percentage of funds allocated to this part of the budget is low compared to the rest of the program.</P>
