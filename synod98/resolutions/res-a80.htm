<p>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</p>

<p>These technical changes are designed to assist the provincial assemblies in nominating
fairly and in good order. The first change makes an individual (rather than an Order)
ineligible for election after having served two terms. Although rotation among the Orders
is desirable, this can be achieved through the electoral process. Without this change,
excluded Orders will mean that the process might be skewed, with several members being
elected by default.</p>

<p>The second change proposed will insure that at least <i>one</i> clergy and <i>one</i>
bishop are elected from each province earlier in the process, rather than the possibility
of one being elected by default at the end.</p>
