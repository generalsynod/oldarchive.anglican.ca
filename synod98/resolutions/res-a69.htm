<P>BE IT RESOLVED:</P>

<P>That Part II of Canon III be repealed and the following substituted therefor: (as attached)</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</P>

<P>A concern was raised in the Council of General Synod about the procedures for electing the Primate. Of particular concern was the fact that little information about those nominated by the Order of Bishops is available to the members of the Orders of Clergy and Laity.  Under the present procedures those Orders are required to vote immediately following receipt of the nominations from the Order of Bishops.</P>

<P>The proposed revision of Part II of the Canon would require the Order of Bishops to make the nominations at least 30 days before the election takes place.  The names of the nominees and biographical information would be sent to the members of the voting Orders.</P>

<P>The revision also restores a provision removed in 1980 providing for resolution, by the order of Bishops, of any deadlock between the Orders of Clergy and Laity.  The revision also abolishes the fiction of an ‘Electoral College&quot;.</P>
