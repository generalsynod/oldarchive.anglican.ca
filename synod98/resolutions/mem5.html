<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following action from the Synod, held September 19-21, 1997, is reported:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.&#9;National Group Insurance Policy</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That a memorial be sent to General Synod urging it to take whatever steps are necessary to establish a national group insurance policy which Anglican churches could opt into if they so desired.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rationale</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has to do primarily with church building insurance, though not necessarily exclusively that, and the expectation that insurance costs could be considerably reduced if there could be a single group policy available from one insurance firm for the whole of the Anglican Church of Canada.</P>
