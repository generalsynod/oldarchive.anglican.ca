<LI>The PWRDF Committee shall consist of 18 members</LI>

<OL TYPE="i">

<LI>8 members shall be elected by the General Synod and 10 members shall be appointed by the Primate</LI>

<LI>at least 4 of the members elected by the General Synod shall be members of the General Synod and one of those shall be a member of the Council of the General Synod</LI>

<LI>1 of the members appointed by the Primate shall be nominated by the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples</LI>

<LI>1 of the members appointed by the Primate shall be nominated by a Canadian indigenous program partner invited by the Primate to make a nomination</LI>

<LI>3 of the members appointed by the Primate shall be nominated by overseas program partners identified by the PWRDF Committee before each meeting of the General Synod.</LI></OL>
</OL>


<P>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</P>

<P>&#9;The PWRDF Committee during the last triennium was composed of 15 members, 4 of whom were representatives of partner organizations and eleven of whom were representatives of the Anglican constituency</P>
<P>&#9;The experience of the committee was that the number of members did not allow for adequate expertise and representation in the program sub-committees which set the priorities and make the allocations.</P>
<P>&#9;This resolution increases the size of the committee to 14 representatives of the Anglican Church of Canada similar to other standing committees of General Synod, plus 4 representatives of PWRDF partner organizations.</P>
