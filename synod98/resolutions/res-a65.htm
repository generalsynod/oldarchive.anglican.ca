<P>EXPLANATORY NOTE/BACKGROUND INFORMATION:</P>

<P>The committee restructuring at the 1995 General Synod assigned responsibility for the Continuing Education Plan to the Pension Committee. That Committee has asked for this change in the method of appointing members to the Administrative Unit since it is now a sub-unit of the Pension Committee. Previously, the members mentioned in sub-section iii) were appointed by the Council of General Synod. </P>
