<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the Most Reverend Michael Peers, Primate, and Members of the General
Synod.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General Synod, meeting in Ottawa in 1995, gave its approval to a new
Strategic Plan. In its restructuring the work of General Synod, national committees were
reduced both in number and in size. Out of this emerged Faith Worship and Ministry - whose
ancestral committees were: a) Doctrine and Worship, b) Ministry, and c) Inter-Church
Inter-Faith Relations Committee. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report consists of three major sections. The first is an account
of how we as a committee worked and functioned in this inaugural incarnation of Faith
Worship and Ministry - with particular reference to our <u>Terms of Reference</u>. The
second section is a summary of actions and developments that took place with each of the <u>tasks</u>
undertaken by Faith Worship and Ministry during this triennium. The third section consists

<p>Section I: Working Together</font><font SIZE="4">

<ol TYPE="I">
  <li>Our meeting, communicating, intentional prioritizing and collaboration</li>
  </font><ol>
    <li>Introduction</li>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first meeting (February 28 - March 1, 1996) took place at the
    International Plaza Hotel alongside the first meetings of all the other standing
    committees of General Synod. For the remaining five meetings of this triennium we met in
    Oakville at St. Michael&#146;s House - Community of the Sisters of the Church (October
    3-6, 1996; May 1-4, 1997; October 16-19, 1997; February 5-8, 1998). The warm hospitality
    which greeted us, and the daily rhythm of prayer into which we were invited to enter,
    formed a solid base on which to engage in the tasks set before us. As we gathered we
    regularly placed in our midst symbols of our life together (and signs of our ancestral
    committees whose concerns we continue to address): Bible, water - sign of our baptism, an
    icon of the Holy Trinity, bowl and towel - sign of our call to be servants, and a copy of
    the Book of Common Prayer and the Book of Alternative Services. </p>
    <b>
    <li>Communication</li>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Communicating our life and work with those beyond the committee
    structure of General Synod was an ongoing concern- both in the sharing of what we were
    discussing, and also in finding opportunities to listen to the concerns and work of others
    in the church. We tried two new ways of facilitating communication (in addition to an
    occasional article in Ministry Matters, our regular reporting to the Council of General
    Synod, and consulting with other committees). </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we began to make use of computer networking, with one of our
    members summarizing our meetings and posting these summaries to an Ecunet discussion group
    (Canadian Anglican Chat). Secondly, we invited several groups active in the life of the
    Anglican Church, but not part of its organizational structure, to come and give a brief
    presentation on their life, ministry and concerns - followed by their joining us for lunch
    and further informal conversation. During this triennium we welcomed at three separate
    meetings, members of the Church Army, the Hoskin Group, and the Prayer Book Society. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Periodically throughout our time discussion took place concerning how
    we might better communicate the work being done with the dioceses and local communities.
    We also maintained contact with Robert Maclennan of Anglican Book Centre publications
    about emergent resources, including the production of the new hymn book, &quot;Common
    Praise.&quot; </p>
    <b>
    <li>Setting Priorities</li>
    </b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At our very first meeting an overview was undertaken of the tasks
    and projects that hade been placed with Faith Worship and Ministry - through the actions
    of General Synod, the ancestral committees of Doctrine and Worship, Inter-Church
    Inter-Faith Relations, and Ministry, various task forces, networks, and ongoing work. We
    utilized an &quot;open space&quot; technique to discuss the tasks, make recommendations
    about how to pursue them, and identify who might be involved. An indication of how much
    energy (actual enthusiasm as well as in terms of anticipated levels of needed expenditure
    of energy) was made for each of the identified tasks. The identified tasks will be found
    in section II of this report.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the list is long, there is a coherency in these tasks being
    considered within a common framework. The number, complexity and nature of these varied
    tasks require, particularly in light of the numbers of committee members and the
    availability of staff resources, the discovery of new ways to accomplish these tasks. It
    was very clear that working on each task &quot;as a committee&quot; or dealing with tasks
    in several &quot;subcommittees&quot; was not an option if more than a handful of tasks
    were to be dealt with. We developed a model of &quot;anchoring&quot; for the tasks. At
    each meeting tasks needing the attention of the whole committee were brought forward -
    either for reporting, or for more extensive time and attention. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the committee have acted as &quot;anchor&quot; persons for
    each task (see below). The thinking behind this concept was that the &quot;anchor&quot;
    would have (or would gain) a familiarity with the particular task which would lead to
    identifying the best means for moving that task forward. Further it would ensure a
    feedback loop between those engaged in the task and the Faith Worship and Ministry
    Committee, under whose mandate those tasks fall. Some tasks consumed a great deal of
    energy in getting them done, while others have been ongoing and have required an attentive
    openness to listen and respond as may be requested or needed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We needed to set priorities for tasks receiving time and attention. It
    needs to be noted that the establishing of a &quot;priority&quot; for each task was not an
    evaluative judgement of its &#145;worth&#146;, rather it had to do with a finite amount of
    energy in the life of the Committee, and how best to prioritize the allocation of that
    energy in meeting the requirements of each task. Hence in our listing of tasks the Hymn
    Book (task 4) received a &#145;low&#146; priority regarding the need for committee energy,
    because the ongoing work of the Hymn Book Task Force, along with staff resources, was
    primarily responsible for moving this work forward. However the development of
    supplementary liturgical material (task 3) received a &#145;high&#146; priority rating
    regarding the need for committee energy, because this set of tasks was directly mandated
    and sent to Faith Worship and Ministry by the General Synod of 1995.</p>
    <b><p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>The Mechanics of Moving the Tasks Forward </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the work of Faith Worship and Ministry, the ability to move tasks
forward in a coordinated manner has depended on the Chair, Director and staff being able
to bring information together from those working on tasks, synthesizing it, and then
encouraging and engaging in facilitative communication which aimed at maximizing
collaboration, and minimizing duplication of effort. An example of this is contained in
Section II - the development and regular updating of task list sheets which outline and
summarize the state and stage of dealing with each task. With the large number of tasks
that comprise the agenda of Faith Worship and Ministry, the use of task sheets has been
invaluable in maximizing the usefulness of agenda time - helping it to be used for
discussing pertinent issues and questions, and helping to minimize the need to continually
review the history and nature of the task at hand. Chair, Director and staff worked
collaboratively in both the accurate recording of information, and in the ensuring that
there is an articulation on the part of &quot;anchors&quot; as to not only where the task
was at the moment, but also in identifying what was needed for the next step in that
task&#146;s moving forward to occur. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over this past triennium the Chair and Director have met regularly
between meetings of the Committee. In addition to the planning of agendas for upcoming
meetings, these meetings have been times of updating on what is happening with the various
tasks, identifying any new situations in the horizon that might fall within our mandate,
and brainstorming strategies for moving the work of the Committee forward. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Coordinating Group of Faith Worship and Ministry met from time to
time to help clarify our agenda, critique our manner of working together and coordinate
communication with the Council of General Synod of with the Mission Coordination Group.
Our very first meeting was to help prepare for the first meeting of the Committee, and
subsequently we have met as occasion required during committee meetings, and also via
conference call. On occasion (particularly at the end of meetings when the lack of time
prevented some matters from being completely resolved) there were tasks that the Committee
passed on to the Coordinating Group to deal with.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agenda for each meeting was formidable and required from the Chair
not only a determination to keep &quot;noses to the grindstone&quot; and maximize the time
we had together, but also required a discerning ear to ensure everyone who needed to be
heard on an issue was given the opportunity and encouragement to contribute. As we
approached more than one issue which could spark intense involvement, it was critical to
always see issues as issues, apart and distinct from the personalities and personal
passions of those around the table. While always respectful of one another, holy humour
carried us through many a moment of tiredness and despair over &quot;too many tasks - too
little time.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With such an agenda, we developed a plan of action that invited each
committee member to &quot;anchor&quot; one or more tasks. The description of what that
entailed emerged and was refined in the course of our work.</p>
<b>

<p>A job description for &quot;Anchors&quot;:</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a person agrees to &quot;anchor&quot; a task, he or she will:
Gather and receive information from other committee members, through research, from
persons contacted, and in committee meetings pertaining to the area of responsibility.
Their responsibility is then to: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Communicate information to relevant committee members;</li>
  <li>Monitor the area of responsibility and analyze and summarize material obtained, for
    report to Faith Worship and Ministry;</li>
  <li>Act as a link to other relevant group(s) and relay information where needed;</li>
  <li>Enlist people from beyond Faith Worship and Ministry Committee for particular tasks, as
    needed, and report names of people proposed for such tasks to the Chair and relevant
    staff;</li>
  <li>Know (or discover) how to find the entry points in their area of responsibility;</li>
  <li>Report all relevant information to Faith Worship and Ministry;</li>
  <li>Periodically advise the appropriate staff person of what is happening in their area of
    responsibility, and seek staff assistance as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<b>

<p>E. Collaboration</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have sought to work collaboratively - with one another and with
other committees, networks, councils and groups. Reporting to the Council of General
Synod, we have also, as occasion demanded or invited, attempted to coordinate overlapping
issues through the Mission Coordination Group. There were a number of people and groups we
connected with over the triennium including: the House of Bishops, Ecojustice, Information
Resources, the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples, Partners in Mission, Diocesan
Liturgical officers, Diocesan Ecumenical Officers, the Churches&#146; Council on
Theological Education; Heads of Theological colleges; the World Council of Churches; the
Canadian Council of Churches, and various offices of the Anglican Communion.</p>
<b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>II. Terms of Reference</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this triennium some revisions were made to the &quot;Terms of
Reference&quot; for Faith Worship and Ministry. What follows are those Terms of Reference,
accompanied by commentary outlining the major ways in which we have carried out our work. </p>

<p>Faith Worship and Ministry shall:

<ol>
  <ol>
    <b>
    <li>Articulate standards and develop resources for worship and liturgy.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>1. &quot;Common Praise&quot; </b>- a new hymn book for the Anglican Church (see Section
II, Task 4)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry inherited from the former Doctrine and
Worship Committee responsibility for the work of the Hymn Book Task Force. We maintained
regular contact with that Task Force, and were kept up to date particularly with the
reporting of Paul Gibson, our recently retired Liturgical Officer. Throughout the
triennium typesetting and work on credit lines and copyright were necessary and frequently
frustrating time consuming areas of work. A halftime copyright clerk was hired to assist
with this process. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two Faith Worship and Ministry Committee members were identified to
review material as it became available - they will also be consulted prior to final
approval being given by the Officers of General Synod to print the finalized work, now
expected to be late summer, 1998. Proofs came to our Committee and then, with further
recommendations, were presented to the Council of General Synod. Our Committee felt it was
important that a hymn book for use in the Anglican Church of Canada include hymn
translations in various aboriginal languages which could be used in those areas where
occasions for worship bring together both aboriginal and English speaking peoples. The
Council of General Synod concurred with this recommendation, and also acted to include the
hymn &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; which had not been previously included in the
collection of hymns for publishing. We are grateful that the Canadian Bible Society will
typeset the syllabic texts.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A joint Introduction Task Force was established between Faith Worship
and Ministry and Information Resources to develop educational/promotional strategy and
materials. Workshops were planned and carried out in every region introducing this new
book. Leaders were trained and feedback has been gathered from those who have attended.
Materials were prepared to introduce &quot;Common Praise,&quot; including a booklet
(&quot;An introduction to Common Praise&quot;) and a cd - for distribution to workshop
attendees.</p>
<b>

<p>2. Development of Supplementary Liturgical Material </b>(See Section II, Tasks 3, 33)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The task of developing supplementary liturgical material was given
Faith Worship and Ministry by General Synod 1995, which called for: (a) an inclusive
language Eucharistic rite; (b) a contemporary Eucharistic rite embodying Reformed
theological conscience; (c) a Eucharistic rite allowing local communities to explore
native and other cultural traditions in Christian worship; (d) French translation of
Baptism, Eucharist, Marriage and Funerals from the Book of Alternative Services; (e) a
service of the Word as the main Sunday act of worship. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a) <b>Inclusive language Eucharistic rite</b>: In developing the two
prayers that are before this Synod, a great deal of discussion took place regarding what
&quot;inclusive language&quot; meant: did General Synod intend the language to be
balanced, non-sexist or emancipatory? Many existing prayers were gathered and evaluated.
The group then proceeded to develop the best possible prayer for use by the whole Church
(and not exclusively for one segment), and which would include women&#146;s role in
salvation history. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b) <b>Eucharistic rite embodying Reformed theological conscience</b>: A
task group met and spent a good deal of time identifying what General Synod meant by
&quot;Reformed theological conscience.&quot; The principles used to develop this
Eucharistic Prayer will be found in the introductory material accompanying the motion to
General Synod regarding Supplementary Liturgical Material.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c) <b>Cultural traditions in Christian worship</b>: After much
discussion, the Committee did not believe the task would be appropriately engaged in by
developing a single Eucharistic prayer. Given the diversity of aboriginal cultures and
spiritualities, alongside the diversity of non-aboriginal cultural expressions, the
Committee believes the way forward is to develop guidelines regarding inculturation and
the exploration of aboriginal and other cultural traditions in liturgical celebrations.
This can most authentically and helpfully be done in partnership and consultation with the
Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples and the multicultural network. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d) <b>French translation:</b> The Committee sought out existing French
liturgical material currently being used in Anglican churches. In the course of this
review we were offered, and received a French translation of the Book of Alternative
Services liturgies of baptism, Eucharist, marriage and funerals. Upon initial
consultation, it appeared that the text was an accurate translation of the Book of
Alternative Services material. However, the evaluation by Francophone Anglicans indicated
that the text did not sufficiently reflect current French idiom and liturgical practice. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee agreed that Faith Worship and Ministry should commission
a French translation of the Book of Alternative Services liturgies of baptism, Eucharist,
marriage and funerals, with the recommendation that such a translation be the work of a
single Francophone translator, and that the commissioned translation be tested by
Francophone members of the Anglican Church of Canada according to the criteria of accuracy
of translation, and consistency with current Canadian French idiom and liturgical
linguistic usage.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">e) <b>Service of the Word</b> for the main Sunday act of worship: Two
forms for a Service of the Word are being provided to Synod for trial use. </p>
<b>

<p>3. Evaluating Translations of the Bible</b> (See Section II, Task 30)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry was requested to examine the Contemporary
English Version (CEV) of the Bible, with a view to making a recommendation to the House of
Bishops as to whether they should authorize it for use in the public worship of the
Anglican Church of Canada. A number of Anglican Biblical Scholars teaching in Canada were
consulted. Early in the process the following general criteria emerged for evaluating
translations of Scripture:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- A translation produced by a group is generally better than a
translation produced by an individual (a group being less likely to miss errors and
eccentricities in textual criticism and translation).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- A translation produced ecumenically is generally better than a
translation produced within a single denomination or theological tradition, since an
ecumenical project is less likely to endorse decisions biased in a particular theological
direction.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- An accurate translation needs to be founded on a good reconstruction
of the original text, through the sound textual criticism of the manuscript tradition.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- A reliable translation needs to be loyal to the original meanings,
avoiding theologically motivated translations. A too loose translation can be inaccurate
or theologically loaded.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">- The style should be accessible. A too literal translation is hard to
understand.</p>

<p>- Inclusive language for humanity should be expected.</p>
<b>

<p>4. Consultation on Common Texts</b> (See Section II, Task 19)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This ecumenical consultation (which has brought us the Sunday three
year Revised Common Lectionary) is one on which the Anglican Church has ongoing
representation. Faith Worship and Ministry has endorsed the circulation and use of the
Revised Common Lectionary. </p>
<b>

<p>B. Foster and facilitate collaboration between Canadian theological colleges, and with
the national church.</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ongoing monitoring and participation in networks - particularly the
meetings of &quot;Heads of Anglican Colleges,&quot; the Churches&#146; Council on
Theological Education (an ecumenical organization of theological educators in Canada),
also the recently held Consultation on Discernment for Ordained Ministry. (See Section II,
Tasks 7, 8,)</p>
<b>

<p>C. Develop policy for, monitor, and engage in inter-church dialogues.</p>

<p>1. Joint Working Group with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (</b>ELCIC) (See
Section II, Task 1)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the very first meeting of the Joint Working Group in 1996, various
issues inviting further exploration, clarification or development, were identified,
including: the threefold order of ministry, the historic episcopate, transferability of
ministries, recognition of pastors from Nordic Baltic countries, collegial and periodic
review of the bishop&#146;s ministry, authority of the House/Conference of Bishops,
participation in each other&#146;s ordinations/installations, lay presidency, the Augsburg
Confession, and shared program and mission. Work on these and other issues continues to
take place in this Working Group and also in the House of Bishops. A Canon is proposed on
first reading to address the question of the reception and recognition of clergy from
churches in full communion. Should full communion be agreed to in 2001, Lutheran clergy
would be covered by that canon.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of this process the Council of General Synod (at their May 1997
meeting) discussed and positively responded to the question posed by the Joint Working
Group: &quot;Are you prepared to view the historic episcopate in the context of the
understandings of apostolicity articulated in <i>Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry, The
Niagara Report, </i>and <i>The Porvoo Common Statement</i>. Other related questions were
addressed to the ELCIC. The Council also endorsed a policy regarding membership i.e. that
lay people of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada moving to the Anglican Church of
Canada are to be received with the same status (baptized/communicant/confirmed) which they
had in the ELCIC. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">See further <i>Called to Full Communion - A Study Resource for
Lutheran-Anglican Relations including The Waterloo Declaration</i>, and the materials
accompanying the motion to approve in principle the declaration of full communion between
the ELCIC and the Anglican Church of Canada.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Anglican Church of Canada, the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in Canada, and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops are all in fruitful but
separate bilateral dialogues with one another, the Council of General Synod has authorized
the participation of the Anglican Church in exploring the best way of establishing an
ongoing theological dialogue involving representatives from all three church bodies.</p>
<b>

<p>2. Other Ecumenical dialogues</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry continued to particularly monitor the
ongoing work of Canadian and international ecumenical dialogues, in particular the
Anglican / Roman Catholic dialogue (See Section II, Task 10) - especially with the
anticipated third statement on Authority (ARCICII) and the recently published booklet and
study guide on the common good, person and participation in society (Canadian
Anglican-Roman Catholic dialogue), and the dialogues with the Orthodox and Oriental
Orthodox (See Section II, Tasks 23 &amp; 24) - especially the theological work around
ecclesiology and trinitarian theology. </p>
<b>

<p>3. Diocesan Ecumenical Officers Conference</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most dioceses have an Ecumenical Officer appointed by the Bishop. This
is one of the existing networks that Faith Worship and Ministry monitors and supports.
(See Section II, Task 12)</p>
<b>

<p>4. National Coalition of Christian Festivals</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last Christian Festival was held in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1994. A
feasibility study is underway to determine if another should be held in Ottawa in
2001.(See Section II, Task 22)</p>
<b>

<p>D. Develop policy for, monitor, and engage in inter-faith dialogues.</p>

<p>1. Published Guidelines for Worship Involving Anglicans and Members of Other Faith
Traditions</b> (See Section II, Task 13) </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The formulation of these guidelines began with a joint working group
comprised of members from the former Inter-Church Inter-Faith Relations Committee and the
former Doctrine and Worship Committee. This task force was given the mandate to prepare
guidelines for marriage and for worship involving persons of other faith traditions. The
first task was completed by the former National Executive Council in March, 1995. This
present set of guidelines was referred to the House of Bishops for their input and
commendation at their meeting in April, 1996.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anglicans are increasingly invited to participate in worship with
people of other faith traditions, in the context of a multi-cultural society and also
against the background of growing dialogue with representatives of some other faith
traditions. Guidelines for inter-faith dialogue were commended to the Church by the
General Synod in 1986. Inter-faith dialogue is a long process and it is not always easy
for a number of reasons. At the same time, it has proven to be rewarding for both partners
in many situations. In the course of dialogue partners are frequently drawn to worship
together, which may raise new difficulties and opportunities. These guidelines are offered
to help Anglicans reflect on the issues raised by these opportunities and their practical
implications for worship events.</p>
<b>

<p>2. Inter-Faith Dialogues</b> (See Section II, Task 14; see also Task 21)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to a request from the Canadian Jewish Congress calling on
other faith communities to join them in asking the Canadian Government that every effort
be made to pursue proceedings against those accused of war crimes in connection with the
Holocaust, Faith Worship and Ministry prepared a statement which the Primate made at a
meeting with Justice Minister Alan Rock. The Christian Muslim Liaison Committee is
struggling with how to be more representative nationally (it is largely Toronto based).
Questions have arisen about what might be done in dialogue with Buddhists, Sikhs and
Hindus.</p>
<b>

<p>E. Promote theological reflection, and provide resources and education on issues of
doctrine, ethics, ministry, ecumenism, leadership, evangelism and mission.</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. At the beginning of the triennium Faith Worship and ministry
responded to the request of the Primate in developing criteria for membership on the<b>
Primate&#146;s Theological Commission </b>(we were asked to consider &quot;what are the
constituencies and points of view needing representation on that body?&quot;). (see
section II, Task 9) Later in the triennium we invited The Rev. Dr. Robert Wright,
Professor of Church History at General Seminary in New York, and the Rev. Don Philips,
Executive Secretary for the Diocese of Qu&#146;Appelle, to assist us in<b> theological
reflection on issues arising from new forms of ministry emerging in the Church</b>. Of
particular focus were those programs rooted in the principle of &quot;mutual
ministry,&quot; &quot;total ministry&quot; or &quot;local ministry.&quot; A number of
issues were raised for further reflection including: expectations (of employment,
placement, movement as well as of licensing), formation and education (where do seminaries
and curricula fit in?), isolation and support, role of bishop and a question of whether
this will create two &#145;classes&#146; of clergy. In view of the need to discover more
of what is happening (not only with &quot;mutual ministry&quot; settings, but also in
&quot;shared ministry&quot; settings), it might be appropriate for Faith Worship and
Ministry to meet in other areas of the country, and to spend some time in an intentional
encounter with the context. </p>
<b>

<p>2. Homosexuality and Homosexual Relations</b> (See Section II, Task 2; also Task 20)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As will be seen in the task summary (Section II, Task 2) a great deal
of exploration and discussion focussed on the mandate given Faith Worship and Ministry by
General Synod in 1995 (Act 58 &quot;Continuing Dialogue on Homosexuality and Homosexual
Relations&quot;) - there have been clergy days in various dioceses, the response of
biblical scholars&#146; has been sought regarding scriptural material in &quot;Hearing
Diverse Voices,&quot; and consideration given as to how best to revise or supplement the
original study material. Evaluation responses to &quot;Hearing Diverse Voices&quot; were
both sought and pondered, and the House of Bishops&#146; Statement received attention.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a strong feeling that a study on the use of Scripture in
moral reasoning be proceeded with as quickly as possible along with how to apply those
principles to the issue of homosexuality and homosexual relationships in particular. There
has also been a strong feeling that discussion needs to be widened to consider the full
range of expressions of human sexuality in relationship (including reference to family and
the single life) and the church&#146;s response to those expressions (making sure that the
diversity of attitude within the Church is represented).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much discussion took place regarding Ecojustice&#146; work on the human
rights principles, <b>&quot;A Covenant of Protection.&quot;</b> Representatives of Faith
Worship and Ministry met with representatives of Ecojustice, who then recommended that
both Committees commend the document, &quot;A Covenant of Protection,&quot; to General
Synod. While the majority of members of Faith Worship and Ministry could not endorse the
statement - considerable discussion arising around both the merits and potential pitfalls
of using &quot;rights&quot; language in the life of the Church, the Committee wished to
try and find some way of contributing to the conversation.</p>
<b>

<p>3. Emerging Ethical Issues</b> (See Section II, Task 28) </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to preparing the statement and background material being
presented to this Synod regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide, discussion ranged
widely regarding emergent ethical issues needing attention and also how the church can
best respond in a timely fashion to requests from various agencies (particularly
governmental agencies and task forces) who from time to time ask for the church&#146;s
input and insight into various ethical issues. Please see further the background material
and motions being presented to this General Synod regarding human cloning.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry requested the Council of General Synod to
establish a task group to examine issues arising from developments in biotechnology and
its management (cloning of livestock, patenting of genetic material, etc.). The group is
to include Anglicans involved in the scientific community, agriculture, ethics, and other
relevant areas. The group will advise Faith Worship and Ministry and Ecojustice as to the
implications of developments in this area, and to assist in articulating the issues raised
by these developments for Canadian Anglicans in response to government initiatives. </p>
<b>

<p>4. Symposium on Ministry</b> (1994) follow up (See Section II, Task 5)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The follow up to this symposium was the production of a video and study
guide - both of which are available from the Resource Centre. </p>
<b>

<p>5. ACPO</b> (Advisory Committee on Postulants for Ordination) and the Consultation on
Discernment for Ordained Ministry (See Section II, Tasks 6, 26)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In May of 1996, the House of Bishops issued a memorandum
&quot;Recommendations to the Council of General Synod re. ACPO.&quot; Our own discussion
of this memo touched on the tension between the desire for national standards, and the
desire of bishops and dioceses to develop their own programs for ministry formation to
meet local needs. Valuable input was given by several of our members who had recently
participated in a Discernment for Ministry conference sponsored by the Ontario Provincial
Consultation on Theological Education. In light of the House of Bishop&#146;s memorandum,
Faith Worship and Ministry offered to the Council of General Synod a suggested proposal
for how to respond to the request to establish a consultation regarding the role of ACPO,
models of ministry, and lines of accountability. The Council requested Faith Worship and
Ministry to establish a consultation.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Consultation on Discernment for Ordained Ministry was made up of 14
people from all the Provinces. They developed an interview process to &quot;seek the mind
of the church,&quot; and altogether 227 people were interviewed (including laity, clergy,
executive officers, and active and retired bishops). Participants also were invited to
share documents outlining methods of discernment used their diocese and information on new
forms of ministry being developed. From this material a second meeting of the consultation
identified a number of common themes out of which emerged recommendations. While much work
remains to be done (not only in the arena of discernment for ordination to the priesthood,
but also with issues pertaining to the diaconate and episcopate), the Committee felt
significant progress has begun as a result of this Consultation. Please see further the
summary of the interim report and the recommendations approved by the Council of General
Synod at their November 1997 meeting, which will be found in Section III of this report to
General Synod. </p>
<b>

<p>6. The Coming of the Third Millennium</b> (See Section II, Task 11)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal of interest arising in the Christian community
and beyond as we approach the dawning of a new millennium. There is a growing focus on the
year 2000 as a year of Jubilee - which challenges and touches us to both engage in
reflection and action in matters of justice, and also to engage in prayer, celebration and
a renewal of hope. </p>
<b>

<p>7. Monitoring work on Evangelism and Mission</b> (See Section II, Tasks 27, 31) </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Primate&#146;s Commission on Evangelism will be meeting in the
spring of 1998. Some clarification is needed regarding the monitoring of
&quot;mission&quot; - particularly in light of the many groups in the Anglican Church
involved in both mission and evangelism.</p>
<b>

<p>8. Faith and Science</b> (See Section II, Task 34)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry were asked to consider establishing a
network of people interested in the interconnectedness between faith and science. Work on
this has just begun.</p>
<b>

<p>F. Monitor work of the Anglican Communion in the areas of liturgy, doctrine, authority
and identity.</p>
</b>

<p>1. Reception of the Work of the <b>International Anglican Liturgical Consultation</b>
(See Section II, Task 18)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommended to the Council of General Synod that the &quot;Principles
and Recommendations&quot; of the Fifth International Anglican Liturgical Consultation held
in Dublin in August, 1995, be commended to the wider Church for study - particularly to
theological colleges and diocesan liturgical officers. These principles and
recommendations relate to this consultation&#146;s work at defining the principles and
standards which will influence the Eucharistic rites which the Provinces of the Communion
will adopt in the course of the next round of revision of liturgical texts. (See Section
III)</p>
<b>

<p>2. Anglican Communion </b>(See Section II, Tasks 17, 32)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to hearing reports from those active in meetings and work
of the wider Anglican Communion, attention was drawn to various reports which having been
prepared for the Anglican Consultative Council at Panama (1996), will also play a role in
the meeting of the Lambeth Conference (1998). In addition, from time to time, we are asked
to reflect with others in the communion on a variety of matters. During this triennium the
Episcopal Church (USA) requested reflection from other provinces in the Anglican Communion
on their involvement in a proposed plan of ecumenical action (Consultation On Church
Union). </p>
<b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>G. Monitor work of the World Council of Churches and the Canadian Council of Churches
in areas of faith and order, ethics, theological education, and inter-faith relations.</b>
(See Section II , Tasks 15, 16, 29)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The World Council of Churches has been engaged in a process of
reflection that has given rise to a new policy statement &quot;Towards a Common
Understanding and Vision of the World Council of Churches,&quot; which will be considered
for approval at the Eighth Assembly to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, in the fall of 1998.
During this past triennium representatives from Faith Worship and Ministry along with
Partners in Mission, PWRDF, the delegates to the WCC Assembly, and several others,
gathered to critique the working draft of the proposed policy statement. This was approved
and sent on to the Council of General Synod for forwarding to the World Council of
Churches. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry commends for use a study guide, <i>Towards
Sharing the One Faith</i>, which was prepared for discussion groups seeking to explore the
apostolic faith as expressed in the Nicene Creed. This guide was recently published by the
World Council&#146;s Commission on Faith and Order.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Faith and Witness Commission of the Canadian Council of Churches is
in the process of publishing a statement and a collection of the member churches&#146;
theologies of marriage. Of particular interest is that recently both the Canadian Council
of Catholic Bishops and the Council of Christian Reformed Churches have become full
members of the Canadian Council of Churches.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry contributed funds to the creation of a video
on Gospel and Culture in Canada. This was an ecumenical project by an ad hoc group
endorsed by the Canadian Council of Churches, Faith and Witness Commission.</p>
<b>

<p>H. Convene gatherings and develop networks related to the work of the Committee.</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The networks - actual and proposed - which relate to the work of Faith
Worship and Ministry, will be found referenced in the task descriptions in Section II.
Further work is being explored in the areas of inter-faith dialogues, the interface of
faith and science, and emergent ethical issues. Gatherings were convened during the
triennium as need and budget allowed (e.g. the Consultation on Discernment for Ordained
Ministry).</p>
<b>

<p>I. Work alongside the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples around aboriginal
spirituality.</b> (See Section II, Task 25)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our ability to move forward with this was initially slowed due to the
absence, because of serious illness, of one of our aboriginal committee members. We were
saddened by her need to resign from the Committee because of illness. We were grateful for
the Primate appointing another representative of our aboriginal community to the
Committee. In the course of our work we heard reports of a workshop at the Rupert&#146;s
Land Provincial Synod led by Bishop Gordon Beardy, as well as from a meeting of the
Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples. In response to their feedback to Faith Worship and
Ministry, we changed the name of Task 25 from &quot;Native Spirituality&quot; to
&quot;Aboriginal Spiritualities.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recognizing the need to study and engage contemporary issues of
inculturation and, in particular the question of the integration of traditions of
aboriginal cultures and spiritualities in the life, ministry and worship of the Church,
Faith Worship and Ministry commits itself to work together with the Anglican Council of
Indigenous Peoples, honouring the principles of partnership set out in the Covenant of
1994 and in the Strategic Plan. Coordination and support for this work could be provided
by the Consultant for Ministry and Worship and by the Coordinator for Indigenous
Ministries.</p>
<b>

<p>J. Work with the House of Bishops to define doctrine where necessary</b>. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there has been no call to &#145;define doctrine&#146; in this
triennium, the Committee consults regularly with the House of Bishops. In particular, the
House was consulted about the supplementary liturgical material, ACPO and the related
issue of theological education, and Lutheran relations.</p>
<b>

<p>K. Use the Lund principle to work ecumenically wherever possible.</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the disappointments we experienced was the lack of ecumenical
partners being members of Faith Worship and Ministry. Despite our requests to both the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops,
representatives were not able to be appointed by these bodies to our Committee. </p>
<b>

<p>L. Report to the Council of General Synod. </p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At each meeting of the Council of General Synod, reports were submitted
by Faith Worship and Ministry requesting action when needed, describing its life and work,
and reflecting on the carrying out of its mandate.</p>
<b>

<p>M. Encourage theological reflection on stewardship and on the committee&#146;s mandate</b>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During this triennium members of Faith Worship and Ministry found it a
challenge to work as well as reflect on all the matters demanded and requested of it. One
of the frustrations we experienced was the limitation of both time and energy to reflect
on matters beyond the tasks falling within our mandate. </p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>III. Nominations</p>
</b></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the triennium, Faith Worship and Ministry responded to a
number of requests for nominating individuals to various committees, boards and
consultations. Most often these nominations were forwarded on to the Council of General
Synod for their consideration and decision.</p>

<p>Canadian Council of Churches Faith and Witness Commission </p>

<p>Christian Muslim Liaison Committee</p>

<p>Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation</p>

<p>Canadian Anglican Roman Catholic Dialogue</p>

<p>Consultation on Common Texts</p>

<p>Churches&#146; Council on Theological Education </p>

<p>Inter-Faith Committee (Corrections Canada)</p>

<p>World Council of Churches Assembly delegates </p>

<p>Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches </p>

<p>Worship Committee of General Synod</p>

<p>Anglican Consultative Council (lay member)</p>

<p>Ecumenical Leadership Award (Centre for Ecumenism in Montreal)</p>

<p>Confirmation of the appointment of ACPO Secretaries (until the responsibility for ACPO
was transferred to the House of Bishops)</p>

<p>Request to the Primate to appoint a replacement for the Rev. Phyllis Keeper who had to
resign from the committee due to ill health</p>

<p>Faith Worship and Ministry 1998-2001</p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>IV. Volunteer Development</p>
</b></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many requests were received for funding and we were able to give
financial assistance in the following ways with projects falling within the mandate of
Faith Worship and Ministry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>assisting in sending a representative to a planning meeting in England for an
    International Local Ministry Conference (which will take place in 1999)</li>
  <li>Diocese of Qu&#146;Appelle for Local Ministries Conference in January 1997 </li>
  <li>Several individuals doing work in the area of inculturation and ministry / worship</li>
  <li>Providing limited assistance in attending / presenting papers at the International
    Anglican Liturgical Consultation </li>
</ul>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the face of receiving requests for far more funds that we had at our
disposal, questions were drawn up to help us prioritize these requests in light of our
Committee&#146;s mandate and areas of responsibility. Each request is asked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does it come out of an ancestor committee?</li>
  <li>What kind of project is it? (Conference, network meeting, research project)</li>
  <li>Has the Committee encouraged the development of the network / conference / research?</li>
  <li>Who is applying: student, Committee member, someone presenting a paper? Does this person
    have access to Continuing Education funds?</li>
  <li>What other sources of funding are available / have been applied for?</li>
  <li>What value is added to the life of the Church as a result of the object of this request?</li>
  <li>What is the cost? What is the amount being requested?</li>
  <li>Does it fit with the mandate for Faith Worship and Ministry as provided by the Strategic
    Plan?</li>
  <li>If it does not, are there compelling reasons to support it?</li>
  <li>What other demands are there for these funds on this budget line?</li>
  <li>Has this person previously received funding from Faith Worship and Ministry, or other
    church sources?</li>
</ul>

<p>Discussion also touched on the benefits of someone gathering of information regarding
sources of funds for bursaries and grants for volunteer development and support. </p>
<font SIZE="4"><b>

<p>V. Identified Tasks for the next triennium</p>
</b></font>

<p>The following have been identified as tasks to be considered or undertaken by Faith
Worship and Ministry in the next triennium:

<ul>
  <li>explore implications of the House of Bishops&#146; statement regarding the blessing of
    covenanted relationships, and any actions of the General Synod in this area;</li>
  <li>set up a task group consisting of a representative group of Canadian Anglican biblical
    scholars to prepare a report on the use of the Scriptures in moral reflection with
    particular reference to matters of sexuality and with reference to singleness,
    heterosexual marriage and same sex unions to be proposed for study in the Church, with
    such study materials as may seem appropriate. The rationale needs to make it clear that
    the emphasis is on the use of Scripture in moral reflection, rather than on the issues
    themselves;</li>
  <li>to design a process of consultation among aboriginal Anglicans and bishops, and to plan
    a feasibility study regarding a core curriculum for theological education;</li>
  <li>in light of negative Francophone reviews of French liturgical texts sent for evaluation,
    it was strongly felt that Faith Worship and Ministry should commission a French
    translation of the Book of Alternative Services liturgies of baptism, Eucharist, marriage
    and funerals with the recommendation that such a translation be the work of a single
    Francophone translator, and that the commissioned translation be tested by Francophone
    members of the Anglican Church of Canada according to the criteria of accuracy of
    translation of the BAS material, and consistency with current Canadian French idiom and
    liturgical usage;</li>
  <li>continue its work of reflecting on issues of health and human values, and especially in
    new developments in this area, by establishing a small task group to draw on expertise in
    the area of reproductive and genetic technologies, health, ethics, and other relevant
    areas, to explore the issues raised for Anglicans by these technologies. The group is to
    be anchored in Faith Worship and Ministry and to provide a resource to Faith Worship and
    ministry to assist in ongoing reflection and enable a timely response to developments in
    this area;</li>
  <li>setting up a network to provide a forum for ongoing reflection and consultation on
    issues of health and human values, particularly in the areas of reproductive and genetic
    technologies, with the aim of assisting the faith communities to respond to government
    initiatives in a timely and informed manner, this to be done in consultation with our
    ecumenical and inter-faith partners;</li>
  <li>foster education, monitor developments, and act on proposals in relationship to the
    Joint Working Group with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, as we move toward a
    decision about full communion;</li>
  <li>continue to monitor and promote the work of dialogue with other churches and with other
    faiths;</li>
  <li>liturgy task group continue its work on Night Prayers and bring a proposed rite to the
    Council of General Synod in the fall of 1998 for permission to publish for trial use
    during a three-year period to conclude with the next General Synod; and that the Faith
    Worship and Ministry Committee be directed to report on the use and reception of the
    prayers to the next General Synod;</li>
  <li>invite a group of representative Canadian Anglican Biblical scholars to serve as a
    committee of reference to evaluate translations of Scripture for use in public worship and
    personal study; to submit significant new translations of Scripture to the committee of
    reference and to report its conclusions from time to time to the House of Bishops, and
    that they evaluate inclusive language Psalters and inclusive language New Testaments for
    use in public worship and for private study;</li>
  <li>explore how they might encourage opportunities and explore possibilities for Canadian
    Anglican theological educators, and others, working in different regions and teaching in
    different kinds of training programs, to make fruitful connections with a view to
    strengthening and enriching the ministry and educational mission of the Church;</li>
  <li>responding to the Council of General Synod, who directed Faith Worship and Ministry to
    undertake a feasibility study on developing a core curriculum for theological education,
    that, in preparation for a feasibility study on core curriculum for theological education,
    a survey of the curricular principles and subject content (either written or oral) of the
    various educational programs for training for priestly ministry across Canada be
    conducted;</li>
  <li>a possible task for Faith Worship and Ministry is the establishment of a task group to
    explore the use of the adult catechumenate in dioceses and parishes as a process of
    mission and evangelism, noting some concern expressed that it might not be in accordance
    with the Strategic Plan;</li>
  <li>continue engagement with the ongoing tasks of Faith Worship and Ministry.</li>

<p>VII. A Word of Thanks</p>
</b></font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chair I would like to give a profound and grateful word of thanks -
first to the members of the Committee, and particularly to the Director, the Rev. Canon
Alyson Barnett-Cowan, and staff of the Department of Faith Worship and Ministry. Alyson
brought a professionalism and competence to each task that was undertaken. Her diligence
and hard work knit tasks and people together efficiently and caringly. Without her
knowledge, experience and personal commitment, this committee would not have accomplished
all that it did. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rev. Paul Gibson, Liturgical Officer for the Anglican Church of
Canada, retired in January, 1998. Paul served on the staff of the General Synod since May,
1972. He joined the staff to assist work in bursaries and theological education, and took
up his liturgical responsibilities in 1986. He will continue to serve part-time as
Consultant for Liturgy for the Anglican Consultative Council until September 1999. Our
thanks goes to Paul for all his work in the liturgical life of the Church, particularly
with the development of the <i>Book of Alternative Services</i> and <i>Common Praise</i>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has not always been easy working with an agenda that felt all
encompassing and at times all too weighty. Our ability, though, to work and make progress
on the tasks at hand was only possible through the knowledgeable and hard work of each
member of the Committee, and because of the active presence, work and contribution of a
very talented staff. Coming not only from widely different parts of the country, committee
members represented a variety of perspectives and concerns alive in the church today We
strove for consensus in decision making - whether it was dealing with processes being
proposed or positions being recommended. In all these things our work was facilitated by
staff who did not hesitate to &#145;go the extra mile&#146; in assisting whenever
possible. The Department of Faith Worship and Ministry is truly gifted with dedicated,
knowledgable, and committed staff. It was truly a privilege to work with them and indeed
with all the members of this Committee. </p>
