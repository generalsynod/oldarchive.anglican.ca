<p>Purpose of the Council 

<dir>
  <dir>
    </b></u><p>The Council meets to provide an opportunity for the bishops to give and receive
    support and accountability. At each meeting members share their concerns particularly
    around the unique situations they are facing due to the number of small communities and
    the distances between them. 15% of Anglicans live in 85% of the land mass of Canada.
    Bishops also share concerns about personnel and personnel policy. New positions are agreed
    upon by all the bishops. Particular problems or issues are discussed and support offered.</p>
    <p>The Council developed a common reporting form for dioceses as a basis to consider
    decisions involving the support grant from the national church. This allows the maximum of
    transparency and accountability within the Council. The form helps in identifying diocesan
    income from all sources. The bishops of the Council are committed to find ways in which
    the council dioceses can become more financially responsible. </p>
    <p>The bishops share information about new initiatives and progress in areas such as
    stewardship, training for ministry, and exploration of new models of ministry.</p>
    <p>. The Council has kept the goals of the national Strategic Plan before it in all its
    discussions.</p>
    <u><b><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Educational Events 

<dir>
  <dir>
    </b></u><p>Two workshops were conducted by John Robertson of the national staff on
    stewardship and planned giving, helping the Council work toward the goal of the strategic
    plan which held up movement toward self sufficiency as one of its aims.</p>
    <p>The yearly meetings with the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples have been important
    aspects of the Council&#146;s continuing education with regard to understanding the
    Covenant and its implications for our ministry. As well, the Council has come to
    understand more fully the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. Donna
    Bomberry and Catherine Morrison of the national staff have been most helpful in this
    process.</p>
    <p>Archbishop Douglas Hambidge was invited to attend one Council meeting to share his
    insights about the early history of the Council and to help us examine our mission and
    share various scenarios as to how we might move towards greater financial responsibility. </p>

<p>Support Grants</b></u> 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>The level of the support grants from the national church has remained constant since
    1995. This, in fact, means a decrease since the costs of ministry, including stipends,
    allowances and benefits have increased by the cost of living. The cuts in 1994 led to
    significant rethinking about the provision of ministry in northern areas. As a result new
    models of ministry are emerging in some dioceses.</p>
    <p>Historically the support grants have been related to the number of full time stipends
    required in the diocese. A recent decision of the Council altered this formula so that
    grants currently are available for all diocesan ministry. A major issue facing the Council
    in the future is the development of a formula for division of the support grant. This
    relates to a review of the goals and objectives in providing ministry in the north, and
    will include the need to develop objective criteria and standards for administering the
    grants. A three-year plan will be helpful in working towards this goal.</p>

<p>Relationship with the Anglican Council of Indigenous Peoples</b></u> 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>A highlight of this triennium has been the close relationship with the Anglican Council
    of Indigenous Peoples. The Council has met three times during the triennium with ACIP, and
    the members have shared at a deep level their concerns and hopes regarding the
    Church&#146;s wrestling with the Covenant and its call for self-determination.</p>
    <p>At the first meeting, facilitated by Dr. Stan McKay, past Moderator of the United
    Church, there was deep sharing, and in the context of worship, discussion and sharing,
    participants from both Councils committed themselves to walking together to discover what
    the Covenant means for our Church. The journey has not been easy, as more discussions on
    more specific implications of the Covenant have revealed different understandings. The
    commitment continues, however, and we are open to go where the Spirit will lead us.</p>
    <p>Both groups have agreed to continue this series of joint annual meetings.</p>

<p>Stewardship and Planned Giving</b></u> 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Several dioceses have taken strong initiatives in stewardship education and action.
    They are reporting increases in giving at the parish level. Ownership at the diocesan
    level has been critical in this increased stewardship awareness. It is recognized that
    there is a great deal of work yet to be done.</p>
    <p>Several dioceses have made planned giving a part of their diocesan program with the
    support of national staff and its pilot project with regional planned giving officers. </p>
    <u><b>

<p>Telling Our Story 

<dir>
  <dir>
    </b></u><p>At each meeting, members of the Council are available to preach in local
    parishes. This has happened at Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg. More work is needed in this
    interpretative task. New and creative ways are required. One hope is that a video will be
    produced in the next triennium to help tell the story of the Church in the North and its
    critical and extensive ministry. The bishops have agreed to spend up to two weeks a year
    in southern dioceses for doing deputation work and supporting the Anglican Appeal.
    Invitations to do this are welcome.</p>

<u><b>

<p>Appreciation</p>
</b></u>

<p>The Council of the North bishops continue to appreciate and support the Anglican </p>

<p>Appeal and the help it provides to the national budget. Approximately one third of the
national budget enables ministry in the North to continue.</p>

<p>In 1893, General Synod was formed with the primary task of supporting mission work in
the West and the North of Canada. This mission continues today. Those who labour in the
north are aware that they are ministering on behalf of the whole church and appreciate the
prayerful and financial support that makes this work possible.</p>
