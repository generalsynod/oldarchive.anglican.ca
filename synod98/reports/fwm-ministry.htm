<p ALIGN="CENTER">Recommendations</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">of the Consultation on Discernment for Ordained Ministry</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">as reviewed by the Council of General Synod, November 1997</p>
</b><font SIZE="3">

<p>The recommendations from the Consultation on Discernment were reviewed and amended by
the House of Bishops, and sent to the Council of General Synod. The recommendations in
sections A, B, D, and E were accepted by the Council. The recommendations in section C
were modified as noted in that section.</p>
</font><u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A. Concerning the Role and Governance of ACPO</p>
</u>

<ol>
  <li>ACPO is advisory to bishops. We recommend that ACPO continue as a national process,
    accountable to the House of Bishops. We recommend that the budget should be set by the
    Council of General Synod and administered for the House of Bishops through the
    Primate&#146;s office.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">There are 4 arenas of discernment: the parish, the diocese, the theological
    college/training institution, and ACPO. While each arena of discernment will assess a wide
    range of criteria and gifts, each has an area of particular responsibility. It is the
    primary responsibility of the parish to assess a candidate in the areas of spirituality,
    leadership, and Christian lifestyle with the noted concern that a parish needs to work at
    objectivity. It is the primary responsibility of each diocese to assess the particular
    gifts of the candidate in the context of its own diocesan needs and ministries. It is the
    primary responsibility of the training institution/theological college to assess
    competency in academic and professional skills. It is the primary responsibility of ACPO
    to assess for the wider church on issues related to character, charisms, and call to
    ordered ministry. All arenas report to the Bishop.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">ACPO&#146;s primary task is to assess for suitability for postulancy for the
    priesthood. ACPO can identify areas in which the candidate needs to grow. We recommend a
    new parallel process to assess for the vocational diaconate to be developed for the year
    2001. Faith Worship and Ministry will oversee the new process which will be developed by
    the ACPO secretaries in consultation with the House of Bishops.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">It is the responsibility of the Bishop and training institution/theological
    college to make decisions about programs of education and formation suitable both for the
    candidate and for the particular form of ministry for which he/she is preparing. An
    intentional process is suggested.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">In order to facilitate clear accountability and structure, we recommend that
    ACPOs be established and held accountable to the House of Bishops through provincial
    structures, e.g. the Metropolitan and Provincial House of Bishops. We recommend that each
    Province have one ACPO coordinating group, consisting of a bishop, Secretary and lay
    assessor. We recommend that the bishop be chosen by the Metropolitan, and that the
    Secretary and the lay assessor be chosen by the Provincial House. The suggested length of
    term is three years, renewable once, and we recommend staggered appointments.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">We recommend the establishment of a national ACPO coordinating group which
    would include the members of the coordinating group from each Province. This will meet not
    less than once in the triennium.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">A pool of assessors needs to be maintained in each Province by the Secretary
    and the lay assessor, on nominations by the diocesan bishops. The pool needs to be
    diverse, including individuals representative of and/or sensitive to the varieties of
    cultures present in the Province, and familiar with the diverse forms of ordered and lay
    ministry present and evolving within the Province.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">Training for assessors is essential. General standards for this training need
    to be set by the national coordinating group. Detailed standards need to be developed by
    the Provincial coordinating group (bishop, Secretary, lay assessor). Training should
    include an exploration of the assumptions assessors are bringing to the task, developing
    clarity and consensus about the task, the theology of the priesthood as found in the
    ordinals, cultural sensitivity training, sensitivity to the particular ministries and
    cultures in the Province, discernment processes and skills, sexual harassment training,
    and confidentiality<b>.</li>
  </b>
  <li VALUE="1">We recommend that the &quot;Checklist of Indicators&quot; presently in use by
    ACPO be revised as amended <i>(Appendix &quot;C&quot;).</i> This Checklist is to be used
    by ACPO assessors in their evaluation of candidates, and is commended to other arenas of
    discernment for their use.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">We recommend special care be taken in the various processes of discernment for
    the selection and screening of postulants for the ordained ministry around the issues of
    power, trust and sexual misconduct. This is in reference to potential abusers and to those
    in the midst of working through personal experiences related to these issues.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">We recommend the national coordinating group to set standards for background
    checks, reference checks and psychological testing in accord with legal counsel. These
    would normally be undertaken by dioceses. It is the responsibility of Provinces to ensure
    that appropriate information arising from these is communicated to the Secretary before
    the ACPO event.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">The entire process needs to be communicated clearly to the candidate at every
    stage, including the fact that there are no guarantees that approval at any stage will
    lead to ordination and/or employment. Recommendations from each arena need to be clearly
    communicated to each of the other arenas, stating what is affirmed, what recommendations
    for the future are being made, and if the candidate is recommended for postulancy to the
    priesthood or not. Use of a release of information form signed by postulant/applicant
    should be encouraged.</li>
  <li VALUE="1">We recommend that, the ACPO contribution occur at an early stage of the
    overall discernment process, as outlined in the 1986 Prerequisites for Ordination
    document.</li>
</ol>

<u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B. Concerning Discernment for the Episcopate</p>
</u>

<ol>
  <li>Recognizing that the exercise of the work and office of the bishop is increasingly
    complex and that less is known about this ministry than either the priesthood or diaconal
    ministry, we recommend that the current national guidelines for the selection and
    screening of nominations for the office of bishop be revisited/updated by the House of
    Bishops.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C. Concerning National Standards for Theological Education for
Ordination</p>
</u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council of General Synod authorized Faith, Worship and Ministry to
undertake a feasibility study in order to do more concentrated work on the issues raised
in these recommendations. This study would include participation from the House of
Bishops, theological colleges, those involved in the training of people for alternative
and complementary forms of ministry, and lay people involved in the life of the Church
with gifts in the areas of adult education</b>.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. We recommend that a basic minimum core curriculum be established for
all being </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">prepared for ordination to the priesthood.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. We recommend that a national core curriculum committee be
established consisting of:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a) 3 representing traditional divinity schools</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b) 2 representing alternative training models</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c) 2 lay persons with a good understanding of today&#146;s Church and
expertise in </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">teaching and learning</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">d) one bishop per province</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. We recommend that appointments be made by the Council of General
Synod on the </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">recommendation of the Faith Worship and Ministry Committee in
consultation with</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the House of Bishops.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. We recommend that the areas of concern for the committee include,
among other</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">matters (See the 1986 document):</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a) the identification of a core curriculum for all to be ordained to
the priesthood</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b) modes of delivery: residency/non-residency</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c) modes of evaluations and examination</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>d)<b> </b>consideration of the manner of assessing readiness for
ordained ministry</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">after all component requirements are met</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">e) consideration of whether there is a role for basic competency
evaluation before</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a candidate begins their theological education</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. We recommend that the committee consult with the House of Bishops
and submit its </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">recommendations to the Council of General Synod through the Faith
Worship and </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministry Committee.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. Intentional education about issues of power, trust, sexual
harassment and abuse need</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to be part of theological education, training for ministry and the
professional and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">vocational growth of all clergy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">D. Concerning Continuing Education</p>
</u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. In accordance with the Continuing Education Plan and with the
knowledge that </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">intentionally addressing professional and vocational growth leads to
enhanced capacity</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">in carrying out the work of the Church, we recommend that all clergy
and bishops </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">design, carry out and evaluate an annual individual professional and
vocational growth </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">plan. Ideally this work will be done collaboratively with their </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">supervisor/metropolitan/bishop, or his/her designate, in a spirit of
mutual inquiry and</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">support.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. We recommend that diocesan leadership publicly articulate</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a) the importance of and benefits accruing from professional and
vocational</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">growth</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b) that professional and vocational growth is part of &#145;the
work&#146; of the clergy</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. We recommend that diocesan leadership assist in resourcing
professional, vocational</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and spiritual growth.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. We recommend that in the area of professional and vocational growth,
dioceses and </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">theological colleges work in stronger partnership.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. We recommend that the recommendations from the Mutual Ministry
Review report</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Committee on Ministry, General Synod 1995) be revisited and form part
of the </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">development of annual evaluation strategies for clergy and their
parishes, to be </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">implemented by 2001.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6. We recommend that bishops and dioceses encourage Sabbatical leaves.</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E. Concerning Discernment and Theological Education with and for
Aboriginal</p>
</u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><u>Anglicans</p>
</u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. We recommend that there be consultation with the Anglican Council of
Indigenous</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peoples and representatives from other diocesan indigenous groups, in
the spirit of</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the Covenant, as to how the issues and proposals raised in this report
can be addressed</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">appropriately in aboriginal contexts. All bishops for whom this is a
particular </p>

<p>concern should have opportunity to be engaged in this conversation.</p>
