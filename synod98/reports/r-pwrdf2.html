    <font face="Arial" size="2">Natural disasters and civil conflict mean that there are 17
    million refugees and 24 million people uprooted from their homes and displaced within
    their countries. PWRDF continued to respond to their needs through support for emergency
    response and programs which respond to the needs of refugees. PWRDF response to
    emergencies is facilitated by Action by Churches Together (ACT) which was established in
    1995 as a joint effort of the World Council of Churches (WCC) and Lutheran World
    Federation (LWF). PWRDF also provided support to strengthen prevention and disaster
    preparedness programs.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The African continent carries the heaviest burden of
    disasters and refugee producing conflicts. PWRDF continued to respond to the needs of
    refugees from Rwanda, Burundi and the Sudan as well as internally displaced people in
    Sierra Leone and Liberia.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Latin America Guatemalan refugees returned from
    Mexico but conflicts in Colombia and Peru continue to produce internally displaced people.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Asia, PWRDF supported refugee programs for Sri
    Lankan refugees in India and Burmese refugees in Thailand. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Canada, the PWRDF Refugee network facilitated
    responses to refugees by Canadian Anglicans including the sponsorship of refugees to
    settle in Canada. For example parishes in the Diocese of Rupert&#146;s Land sponsored a
    refugee family from Rwanda and the refugee network in the Diocese of Qu&#146;Appelle
    raised funds to support this sponsorship. Another response to refugee concerns is to
    promote actions of solidarity with refugees. Over the last triennium, following a
    resolution at the 1995 General Synod, individuals wrote letters to the government
    expressing opposition to government regulations imposing a &quot;Head Tax&quot; of $975 on
    refugees. </font></p>
