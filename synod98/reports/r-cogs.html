<p><small>To the Members of the General Synod:</small></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;

  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>
  <li>THE COUNCIL, ITS MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS</li>
  </b></font><p><small>The Council, consisting of 40 members, is the successor to the
  National Executive Council, was established by the 1995 General Synod. The Council met six
  times during the Triennium and submits this report of its actions. The first
  organizational meeting was held during the 1995 General Synod when various housekeeping
  matters were discussed.</small></p>
  <p><small>In the fall of 1995 the regular meetings of the Council and of committees were
  cancelled as the result of a budgetary measure taken in 1994. Savings of $250,000 were
  realized, but this action delayed the commencement of much committee and council work. The
  first full meeting of the Council in March, 1996 was in the context of a meeting of all
  committees, with overlapping time for all participants to review and reflect on the 1995
  strategic plan.</small></p>
  <p><small>An invitation was extended to the Executive Council of the Episcopal Church USA
  to meet with our Council, and that meeting took place in November, 1996 in Toronto. Each
  Council met separately for part of the time, and joint sessions provided opportunities for
  the council members to discuss mutual concerns and participate with each other in
  exploration of issues. Reports on the 10th meeting of the Anglican Consultative Council
  and on planning for the Lambeth Conference, 1998, were shared. An overseas partner, The
  Reverend Miguel Tamayo, a Cuban priest working in Uruguay participated in the meeting and
  shared his reflections. The participants visited the Church of the Holy Trinity in
  downtown Toronto where they were welcomed by the Bishop of Toronto and the parish
  community. The Presiding Bishop, Edmund Browning, expressed appreciation to the Council of
  General Synod for this special occasion.</small></p>
  <p><small>The next meeting of the Council in May, 1997 was held in Vancouver, in response
  to an invitation from the Bishop of New Westminster. Included were opportunities for
  members to visit different aspects of mission work in the diocese, a diocesan dinner and
  participation in worship in local parishes.</small></p>
  <p><small>The two remaining meetings were held in Mississauga in November, 1997 and March,
  1998.</small></p>
  <p><small>At most meetings, partners from the Episcopal Church USA were present and
  reflected with the Council on their perceptions. Appreciation was expressed to the
  Reverend Ran Chase, Diane Porter and Vernon Hazlewood who shared in this partnership. On
  behalf of the Council, Dean James Merrett, Archdeacon Rodney Andrews and Suzanne Lawson
  attended various meetings of the Episcopal Church&#146;s Executive Council and reported
  back from time to time. The Council agreed to extend this partnership for the next
  triennium.</small></p>
  <p><small>At each meeting the Primate reported to the Council, giving a review of his
  activities and outlining the challenges he saw and the opportunities that lay before the
  Church.</small></p>
  <p><small>At the May, 1997 meeting, the Council reviewed in depth two goal areas of the
  strategic plan: <b>Ministry in the North</b> and <b>Ecumenical Relations</b>. At the same
  meeting, an extensive review of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Report was
  undertaken.</small></p>
  <p><small>One Council member from the Diocese of Ontario, Mary Lou Workman, resigned in
  1996 and was replaced by Dorothy Davies Flindall.</small></p>
  <p><small>During the course of the triennium, two Officers of General Synod resigned.
  Suzanne Lawson, the Executive Director of Program, left in 1997 to accept another
  position. Suzanne was responsible for facilitating the development of the Church&#146;s
  strategic plan and committee restructuring of 1995. Robert Armstrong resigned in 1997 as
  Treasurer.</small></p>
  <p><small>The Council at its last meeting granted the Anglican Award of Merit to:</small></p>
  <p><small>Mrs. Betty Gracie Toronto</small></p>
  <p><small>Ms. Kendra Gregson Niagara</small></p>
  <p><small>Canon Michael Iveson Ottawa</small></p>
  <p><small>Mr. Grant Walker New Westminster</small></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>
  <li>Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault Guidelines</li>
  </b></font><p><small>In 1996 the Council concurred with an action by the Officers in
  establishing a review process for the above Guidelines. Ms Linda Barry-Hollowell of St.
  Catharines chaired the review group and, following extensive consultation, reported to the
  March, 1998 meeting. Revised <b>Guidelines</b> were approved.</small></p>
  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>
  <li>General Synod, 1998</li>
  <ol TYPE="a">
    </b></font>
    <li><small>The Council chose McGill University, Montreal as the site for the 1998 General
      Synod, May 21 to May 29.</small></li>
    <li><small>In November, 1996 the Council appointed a task force to conduct a review of the
      1995 video broadcasts. </small></li>
  </ol>
  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>
  <li>Financial Concerns</li>
  <ol TYPE="a">
    </b></font>
    <li><small>In each year the Council received the annual audited consolidated financial
      statements and approved budgets for the ensuing year for the General Synod, Primate&#146;s
      World Relief and Development Fund and the Pension Fund. The Council also directed the
      Financial Management and Development Committee to prepare a three-year budget for
      1999-2001.</small></li>
    <li><small>The Council adopted principles to govern financial development of PWRDF, setting
      it clearly in the context of parish stewardship, noting that it is part of the national
      program of the Church, yet a separate fund, and that networking and sharing of information
      are critical goals.</small></li>
    <li><small>In May, 1997 the Council approved an increase in assessment for the Continuing
      Education Plan from $225 per year to $600 per year, to be phased in over a three year
      period, with cost sharing arrangements as between employee (25%) and employer (75%)
      remaining as at present: </small></li>
    <li><small>The Council accepted recommendations arising out of a feasibility study on a
      coordinated fundraising campaign. The study indicated that this is not the time for a
      nationally coordinated fundraising campaign but that the national church has a role in
      continuing the Anglican Appeal, its planned giving work, and other pilot projects in
      partnership with dioceses.</small></li>
    <li><small>The Council authorized the Officers to negotiate further with a developer
      regarding the possible sale of Church House and its replacement with a high rise
      residential development which would house the national church offices on the lower floors.</small></li>
    <li><small>The Council endorsed the principles in a Proportional Giving Proposal for
      Diocesan Funding of National and International Mission and Ministry for presentation to
      General Synod. This proposal would replace the present Assessment and Apportionment
      requests to dioceses.</small></li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>
  <li>ACPO and Discernment for Ministry</li>
  <ol TYPE="a">
    </b></font>
    <li><small>The Council requested the Faith, Worship and Ministry Committee to establish a
      consultation to review the role of ACPO and related matter of discernment for ministry. A
      major recommendation which was accepted was to transfer responsibility for ACPO to the
      House of Bishops, to be administered through the Primate&#146;s Office. The report called
      for the development of a parallel process for assessment for the vocational diaconate by
      2001. Other recommendations touched on concerns about the discernment process and the
      relevant roles of the Bishop, theological college and ACPO.</small></li>
    <li><small>The Council also called for a feasibility study by the Faith, Worship and
      Ministry Committee regarding national standards for theological education in Canada.</small></li>
    <li><small>Strong endorsement and encouragement of continuing education for clergy was given
      by the Council in adopting further recommendations from the consultation.</small></li>
    <li><small>Further consultation is to take place with regard to discernment for ministry in
      aboriginal contexts.</small></li>
  </ol>
  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b><p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li>Health Benefits for Same Sex Partners</li>
  </b></font><p><small>In March, 1996 the Council reviewed a decision taken by the Pension
  Committee to make it possible for participating employers to provide benefits for same-sex
  partners, noting that this decision does not change the doctrinal position of the Anglican
  Church on marriage, as expressed in Canon XXI.</small></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>
  <li>Appointments</li>
