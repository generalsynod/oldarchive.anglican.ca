    <font face="Arial"><small>At the heart of the ministry of PWRDF are partnerships focused
    on promoting global peace and justice -- partnerships between people and communities in
    and within Canada and with people and communities overseas. PWRDF makes financial and
    human resources available to support the relief and development initiatives of partners,
    to strengthen these partnerships and to promote knowledgeable actions of solidarity and
    advocacy. PWRDF&#146;s partners contribute their skills and capacities to the work they
    undertake in their communities and to PWRDF&#146;s work in Canada.</small></font></p>

    </div><p><font face="Arial"><small>1994 was a year of great joy -- the elections in South
    Africa and tremendous tragedy -- the genocide in Rwanda. Since then, PWRDF has continued
    in partnership with organizations committed to peace-building. In South Africa the focus
    of efforts was on community peace building and healing of memories after years of communal
    and racial violence. In Rwanda and Burundi the focus was on repatriation and
    reconciliation efforts between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. Support was provided to peace
    initiatives in Mozambique. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A constant component of the work in Africa has
    been to strengthen efforts to promote Gender and Development awareness. In East Africa two
    of the Anglican churches have developed Gender and Development Desks for their community
    development programs. The partners supported by PWRDF in the Sudan and in Ethiopia have
    also promoted Gender and Development in their programming. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working in partnership means strengthening the
    capacity of partners to undertake development work. Resources from PWRDF have been used
    for training programs and staff development for many of our partners in Africa. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of PWRDF support went to the integrated
    community development programs of partners in Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, the
    Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and the Sudan.</small></font></p>

    </div><p><font face="Arial"><small>A critical struggle in Asia is the struggle about
    economic models. The Philippines and Sri Lanka considers themselves to be one of the Asian
    economic &#147;Tigers&#148; following the example of Korea and Malaysia but these
    economies have been showing signs of wear and tear. Job losses, devaluation of currencies
    and high inflation have all been part of efforts to salvage the model of newly
    industrialized countries (NICs). PWRDF and partners in the region have gathered around the
    meetings of APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) held in Manila in 1996 and Vancouver
    in 1997. Their message has been that people, not markets, should dictate government
    policies. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New governments in both Sri Lanka and the
    Philippines were welcomed with optimism but over the years this has turned to
    disappointment. In Sri Lanka the civil conflict between Tamil and Sinhala populations has
    been waged on military fronts. PWRDF has supported partners&#146; efforts at peace and
    reconciliation as well as ongoing community development projects. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Philippines, PWRDF continues to work in
    partnership with the Philippines Advisory Group -- an expression of partnership in which
    PWRDF&#146;s partners in the region gather to provide direction for PWRDF&#146;s work in
    the Philippines and discuss how they might help PWRDF&#146;s work in Canada. PWRDF
    financial support continues for community development work, innovative programs of
    disaster preparedness and social justice groups. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PWRDF continues to support work in Bangladesh
    and over the past triennium began to phase out support to programs in China, Burma and
    India in an effort to focus PWRDF attention and resources in a way that makes a difference
    rather than being spread too thin.</small></font></p>

    </table>
    </div><p><font face="Arial"><small>In the Latin American region most military governments
    have been replaced by civilian governments but the new governments have done little to
    improve the lives of the poorest of the population. In fact, in many ways, they are worse
    off. The globalization of economies and free trade has resulted in the poor become poorer
    and more marginalized. They are increasing distant from the decision-making processes that
    affect their lives. Mexico is a case in point where the gap between the rich and the poor
    is growing and violence in society has become endemic. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Central America, PWRDF has supported peace
    building initiatives in El Salvador and Guatemala as well as the efforts of partner
    organizations to develop sustainable alternatives in health care and income generation.
    Special attention has been given to programs supporting indigenous women, especially in
    Guatemala and Mexico where they are victims of multi layered violence. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong focus for PWRDF has been Brazil --
    not one of the world&#146;s poorest countries but a society in which the face of poverty
    is desperate indeed. Street children, indigenous people and poor rural women have all
    borne the burden of a society which favours the rich and the powerful. PWRDF&#146;s
    partners have developed programs to reach out to the poor and the marginalized and
    strengthen their participation in society. </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to the significant role played by
    Cuba&#146;s Protestant churches in opening up new areas of community participation,
    PWRDF&#146;s support to ecumenical partners in Cuba has become important for housing,
    health and agricultural programs.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#808000"><strong><br>
    Global</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>PWRDF has continued to support a number of global programs.
    Through the World Council of Churches and ecumenical coalitions such as Inter Church
    Action, PWRDF has supported programs in many parts of the world focusing on health and
    sustainable agriculture. PWRDF has also provided supported to south/south exchanges for
    information and learning through the Frontiers in Mission program. The Anglican
    Church&#146;s participation in global campaigns such as the landmines campaign and the
    Fair TradeMark campaign have been supported through global grants.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#808000"><strong><br>
    Canada</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Arial"><small>An exciting development over the last triennium has been the
    strengthening of the Canadian program. This program has focused on strengthening community
    development initiatives in aboriginal communities across Canada. A full time staff person
    was appointed, and in 1997, the budget for work in Canada increased and criteria for PWRDF
    support have been developed.</small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exciting work has begun in partnership
    with the Nuu-Chah-Nulth Economic Development Corporation in British Columbia in an
    international partnership with Maori in New Zealand and Miskito in Nicaragua developing
    joint ventures in fisheries and forestry. PWRDF has supported Nets&#146;enelu 97 - a
    women&#146;s artisan group in NWT - to develop an enterprise incorporating traditional
    handwork into fashion clothing design. PWRDF has promoted a partnership between the Six
    Nations International Development Agency and the First Nations Technical Institute to
    develop both a policy think-tank on aboriginal issues and a newsletter and electronic
    communications to share the learnings from the think-tank with indigenous and
    non-indigenous organizations in Canada. </small></font></p>
