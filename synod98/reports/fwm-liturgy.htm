<p ALIGN="CENTER">Supplementary Liturgical Material</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are five liturgical documents in this collection: three
Supplementary Eucharistic Prayers (S1, S2, and S3), and two Services of the Word (SW1,
SW2)</p>
<b><u>

<p>Supplementary Eucharistic Prayers</p>
</u></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General Synod in 1995 called for the creation of eucharistic prayers
reflecting a Reformed theological conscience and eucharistic prayers inclusive in language
and images. The Faith Worship and Ministry Committee invited submissions from
representative groups in the Church and appointed a sub-group to process the responses and
develop fresh liturgical texts. Three texts have been created: one reflecting the Reformed
theological conscience, and two distinct inclusive prayers reflecting different points of
view of which the Committee became aware.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In seeking to follow the instructions of General Synod, the Faith
Worship and Ministry Committee first gave consideration to what might be intended by the
terms &#145;Reformed&#146; and &#145;inclusive.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An understanding of &#145;Reformed&#146;</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &#145;Reformed refers to a theological culture strongly
influenced by the sixteenth century Christian leader John Calvin. The Thirty-Nine Articles
of Religion of the Church of England are generally regarded as consonant with, and perhaps
historically inspired by, Reformed doctrine. Through the centuries, many in the Anglican
world have identified themselves as members of the Reformed theological community. The
eucharistic prayer in the Book of Common Prayer of 1559 is often regarded as one of the
most distinguished examples of a liturgy consistent with a Reformed theological
conscience.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was our conclusion that a Reformed eucharistic theology should
reflect the following emphases: (1) God is sovereign, and God is generous in love, grace,
and pardon beyond anything we can ask, deserve, or control; (2) in the eucharist what is
important is what God does, not anything that we do; (3) in the eucharist God confirms the
benefits of the finished work of Christ, and seals the promises of the Gospel; (4) what we
have to offer God is ourselves, and our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving for
Christ&#146;s work of redemption; (5) claims should not be made for the physical elements
of bread and wine which obscure the truth that God is at work in all creation.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An understanding of &#145;inclusive&#146;</p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We understand an &#145;inclusive&#146; prayer as one which includes all
members of the Church community, through word and symbol. There are different ways of
conveying inclusivity. We approached the task by attempting to incorporate various images
of God and God&#146;s work in a balanced way. Our aim was to use the resources of the
Christian tradition to expand the language of prayer, within the Trinitarian structure of
our eucharistic prayers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prayers recognize the reality of those groups who feel cut off from
the community of Christ. It may that a particular community is in a situation in which it
feels abandoned by the Holy One. An example of the latter might be a congregation in a
town where the mill or other major industry has closed down. In such cases, even though a
Eucharist is normally a prayer of praise, there are times when praise is difficult: times
of anger, frustration, disappointment, and loss. In one of these prayers we have attempted
to provide an opportunity for groups who feel alienated from God or the Church to be heard
and therefore held as part of the community.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We sought as well to be inclusive of ecological realities,
understanding that God has created us out of the earth and has commanded us to be
responsible stewards of creation.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Services of the Word</p>
</b></u>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1995 General Synod, following the recommendations of the BAS
Evaluation Commission, requested a Service of the Word as the main Sunday act of worship.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Faith Worship and Ministry Committee proposes two services of the
Word. The first might be described as an expanded and more &#145;user-friendly&#146;
version of Morning and Evening Prayer in the Book of Alternative Services. It is designed
for simplicity and minimal preparation. The second service conforms more closely to the
shape of the liturgy of the Word in the Eucharist. It is also simple in design.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While both services will normally be celebrated on Sundays, the day of
Resurrection, they may equally be used at any weekly gathering of the community of faith.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We invite those using these prayers to make their views known to us.

<p>12 in the fullness of time you sent Jesus the Christ</p>

<p>13 to share our fragile humanity.</p>

<p>15 you open the path from brokenness to health,</p>

<p>16 from fear to trust,</p>

<p>17 from pride and conceit to reverence for you.</p>

<p>18 Rejected by a world that could not bear the Gospel of life,</p>

<p>19 Jesus knew death was near.</p>

<p>20 His head anointed for burial by an unknown woman,</p>

<p>21 Jesus gathered together those who loved him.</p>

<p>22 He took bread, gave thanks to you, broke it</p>

<p>23 and gave it to his friends,</p>

<p>24 saying, &quot;Take and eat: this is my body</p>

<p>25 which is given for you.</p>

<p>26 Do this for the remembrance of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27 After supper, Jesus took the cup of wine,</p>

<p>28 gave you thanks, and said</p>

<p>29 &quot;Drink this all of you, </p>

<p>30 this is my blood of the new covenant </p>

<p>31 which is shed for you and for many.</p>

<p>32 Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me.&quot; </p>

<p>33 And now we gather at this table in response to his commandment,</p>

<p>13 because in your tender love you gave the world your only Son,</p>

<p>14 in order that the world might be saved through him.</p>

<p>15 He made you known by taking the form of a servant,</p>

<p>16 healing the sick, liberating the oppressed,</p>

<p>17 reaching out to the lost.</p>

<p>18 Betrayed, reviled, and nailed to the cross,</p>

<p>19 he confronted the power of sin and disarmed it for ever.</p>

<p>20 In his offering of himself,</p>

<p>21 he became the perfect and sufficient sacrifice</p>
