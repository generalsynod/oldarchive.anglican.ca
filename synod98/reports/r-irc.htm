<ol TYPE="A">
  <li>Overview of the Committee's Work</li>
  <ol>
    </b>
    <li>The committee was created by the 1995 strategic plan, with a mandate to &quot;develop
      and oversee a communications policy for the national church, including work done through
      the Anglican Journal, Archives and ABC advisory boards,&quot; and to coordinate that work
      with all other communications work. The triennium has been marked by responsiveness to a
      new mandate, a new structure, ongoing work, and specific directions from General Synod.<br>
    </li>
    <b>
    <li>In response to the mandate</b>, the Committee has taken significant initiatives in
      policy development, evaluation and analysis, and provision of services:</li>
    <ol TYPE="a">
      <li>developing and prioritizing work in communications through analysis of our key audiences
        and their needs. This work is ongoing;</li>
      <li>creating a policy framework to guide the work of ABC publishing;</li>
      <li>clarifying the committee function as publisher of the Anglican Journal, while ensuring
        the Journal's editorial independence;</li>
      <li>conducting a detailed evaluation of the General Synod broadcasts and developing
        recommendations for future broadcasts;</li>
      <li>clarifying the functions identified in <i>Preparing the Way</i> to distinguish between
        the Committee's <i>policy and oversight</i> functions, and the staff's <i>implementation</i>
        functions. For example, the term &quot;provide support in media relations&quot; (noted in <i>Preparing
        the Way</i>) is a staff function and so was removed from the Committee terms;</li>
      <li>working with staff to develop a budget presentation format that assists the Committee in
        its oversight functions;</li>
      <li>in keeping with our key audience analysis, approving the expansion of <i>Ministry
        Matters</i> from two to three times a year. The periodical serves key parish and diocesan
        leaders, both lay and clergy;</li>
      <li>also in keeping with our audience analysis, approving an Anglican Video special
        production on prayer and healing. As a broadcast, this documentary will be accessible to
        members of the church, but will also reach beyond current membership to present the
        Anglican Church as a source for spiritual growth. Additional print resources and study
        guides will make the documentary useful for group or individual reflection. It will air in
        the Fall of 1998;</li>
      <li>directing greater budget energy, in the latter part of the triennium, into Anglican
        Journal Editorial and website development;</li>
      <li>approving priorities for archival research assistance in relation to residential schools
        litigation, and noting the advisory board's approval of revised research procedures, and
        of the Association of Canadian Archivists Code of Ethics;</li>
      <li>creating a new information resource, <i>Faces and Ministries</i>, a special issue of <i>Ministry
        Matters</i> which provides an overview of the ministry conducted in and through the staff
        of General Synod. This will be a useful resource for diocesan and parish leaders over the
        next triennium, and will be evaluated for possible re-publication before the next General
        Synod.</li>
      <li>initiating policy development on significant questions related to information management
        and focused, in the current instance, on the degree to which baptism records are, or
        should be, considered public information;</li>
      <li>seeking to learn from all opportunities for dialogue and feedback with our key
        audiences, including:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>conducting a series of focus groups (in Nova Scotia, Ottawa, Niagara and New
          Westminster) to probe the use of music in worship and identify issues in the introduction
          of <i>Common Praise</i>;</li>
        <li>through staff, making personal visits through the course of the triennium to most
          diocesan book stores or resource centres, and seeking to enhance relationships with them;</li>
        <li>authorizing a professionally-designed readership survey of Anglican Journal readers. The
          survey was designed primarily to serve the needs of advertising, but it also provides
          useful information about our active members;</li>
        <li>continuing a regular series of archival training workshops, organized on a Provincial
          basis</li>
        <li>organizing a series of introductory workshops for <i>Common Praise</i>, and analyzing
          the workshop evaluations.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>

<ol>
  <ol>
    <b>
    <li>In response to the new committee structure</b> -- and the new staff structure
      established subsequently (see figure 1) -- the Committee has worked consistently
      throughout the triennium to assess the effectiveness of its structure in carrying out its
      mandate. This work has produced revised Terms of Reference (Appendix A) which the
      Committee believes are a next step in the spirit of <i>Preparing the Way</i>. The revised
      terms of reference, if approved by this General Synod, will offer the next Information
      Resources Committee a solid policy foundation on which to build.<br>
    </li>
    <b>
    <li>In response to ongoing work</b>, the Committee has exercised oversight of the work
      conducted through the three advisory boards and the other communications work not
      represented by an advisory board. Some noteworthy elements:</li>
    <ol TYPE="a">
      <li>a joint task force, with Faith Worship and Ministry, has been at work through most of
        the triennium focusing on completing the production of <i>Common Praise</i> and ensuring
        its effective introduction to the church. It is anticipated the new hymn book will be
        available for shipping by summer. Barring unforeseen delays, parishes which have ordered
        the book by mid-July will receive their order by September 1. <i>Common Praise</i> is
        being received enthusiastically in introductory workshops.</li>
      <li>financial management in relation to the Anglican Book Centre has been a concern through
        most of the triennium. The advisory board, committee, and staff have found their energies
        directed more toward attempting to secure accurate information, and less toward the
        critical task of analysing the information and directing the operation. Beginning in 1998,
        the situation has significantly improved. The 1997 year end inventory was completed to the
        satisfaction of both staff and auditors. Detailed year over year sales data became
        available for the first time. A new financial management software package for the General
        Synod, anticipated to begin operation by the second quarter of 1998, will permit the
        development of a customer database to improve both sales analysis and service levels. <br>
        An operating loss in 1997 has reduced the Centre's level of retained earnings. However,
        the financial tools now in place (together with other measures) indicate a return to
        profitability in 1998. The committee commends the work of the Treasurer and the book store
        management in resolving the information issues, and is grateful for the cooperation and
        support provided by the Financial Management and Development Committee during this
        process.</li>
      <li>other efforts in the merchandising and distribution section of ABC have focused on
        improving service (for example, a new phone system allows callers the option of placing
        their order automatically or waiting in a queue for the first available customer service
        representative), enhancing our marketing program (with new catalogues and attractive
        seasonal promotions) expanding our sales to other retailers (through regular personal
        sales calls), acquiring Canadian distribution rights for selected lines of merchandise
        (for example, Heritage pew bulletins) and increasing our penetration of non-Anglican
        markets. These activities are all showing signs of promoting sales growth.</li>
      <li>the <i>Anglican Journal</i> underwent significant change during the triennium: a new
        editor, the Rev. David Harris, took office in January 1996, after working as a reporter,
        front page editor, and religion editor with the Halifax Chronicle Herald; a new design
        reflects current standards in newspaper typography and design, and improves readability; a
        renewed focus on news reporting has stimulated readership and response; a half-time
        reporting/editing position has been added. The Journal has regularly been recognized by
        the Canadian Church Press and the North America-wide Associated Church Press (ACP), and
        this triennium is no exception. In 1997, the Journal garnered ACP's top award for
        excellence.</li>
      <li>the General Synod Archives acquired and catalogued significant additions to the holdings
        of the Arctic collection during the triennium, assisted by grants from the Canadian
        Council of Archives, Anglican Foundation, and the Makavik Corporation.</li>
      <li>Library staff have continued to provide research and reference services to national
        staff and committees, diocesan and parish leaders and others based on their unique
        collection of Communion-wide resources. </li>
      <li>staff in several areas of Information Resources, especially library and circulation have
        been heavily involved throughout the triennium in a project, now nearing completion, to
        develop a common Church House database. The system will allow more accurate and efficient
        use of information. </li>
      <li>Information Resources does not have primary responsibility for any of the priorities of <i>Preparing
        the Way</i>. However, it provides services and products that help to advance the plan's
        priorities in all areas. Attached, as Appendix B, is a list of Information Resources
        products and services over the past triennium, organized by strategic priority.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>
    <li>In response to resolutions</b> referred by the 1995 General Synod, the Committee:</li>
    <ol TYPE="a">
      <li>endeavored consistently to emulate the values of flexibility, responsiveness and trust,
        and the other themes noted in the &quot;New Ways Of Working Together,&quot; (from <i>Preparing
        the Way</i>) both with other committees and within its own operations (A91A)</li>
      <li>made an early identification of electronic communications facilities available to the
        Implementation Team. (B73) By the end of the triennium, all Information Resources
        Committee members were accessible by email, and the Committee was able to conduct some of
        its business (including reviewing this report) by use of an electronic mailing list.<br>
        <br>
        All other referrals (A66, A67 and A81) have to do with terms of reference and have been
        dealt with in the proposed terms brought before this General Synod.<br>

<ol TYPE="A">
  <b>
  <li>Ongoing and Future work commended to successor committee</li>
  <ol>
    </b>
    <li>Continued policy development</li>
    <ol TYPE="a">
      <li>in the areas of Information Services which do not yet have adequate articulation of
        policy;</li>
      <li>in Merchandising and Distribution, to address issues related to the relationship between
        sales and mission;</li>
      <li>in Resource Production, to develop a broader statement of policy, including video
        production and website development policies, along with the existing publishing policy;</li>
      <li>development of a guideline for committees or other groups considering production of a
        resource. The guideline should address the stages of resource development, including
        target audience, key messages, intended results, budget and other elements including -- as
        requested by the Mission Coordinating Group -- the methods of distribution for the
        proposed resource, and the choice of language or languages for the proposed resource.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Attention to ABC sales and marketing issues</li>
    <ol TYPE="a">
      <li>begin development of database marketing as soon as permitted by the new information
        system; experiment with electronic commerce and electronic publishing;</li>
      <li>the store's needs for adequate retail space, especially a presence on the street, must
        be addressed in any Church House relocation or redevelopment</li>
      <li>management must continue its attention to sales analysis to ensure profitability</li>
      <li>the reception of <i>Common Praise</i>, and decisions about whether to publish other
        editions of the book (e.g., words only or words and melody only) will have significant
        impact;<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Enhance revenue generation<br>
      Advertising revenue in the Anglican Journal is in decline. The readership survey noted
      above was initiated to provided useful data to support increased sales. A further
      initiative in 1998 involves testing the effectiveness of an integrated revenue production
      strategy, in which on-page advertising, mailing list rental, broadcasting sponsorship
      opportunities, website relationships, and possibly other elements, are combined for
      greater impact. This model will need careful analysis and evaluation in the Fall of 1998
      to determine next steps.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Increase attention on networking to serve diocesan priorities<br>
      The work of this triennium has been disproportionately focused on issues arising from
      restructuring and reorganization. With this accomplished, Information Resources should
      turn more toward <i>Preparing the Way</i>'s emphasis on networking and providing service
      to dioceses: &quot;Develop a volunteer and staff resource capacity to assist dioceses in
      handling financial, legal, communications, personnel, property issues.&quot; This might
      include establishment of a volunteer &quot;experts&quot; list in, for example,
      conservation of material heritage; or training programs for dioceses facing potential
      litigation arising from residential schools or other issues. It will involve expansion of
      research and reference services focused on diocesan priorities. Other kinds of services
      will be developed through our emerging use of electronic communications.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Freedom of Information and Right to Privacy<br>
      There is a need for some focused work on resolving the potential for conflict between the
      principles by which we seek to make public information freely available, while protecting
      individuals' rights to privacy. The question arises in this instance from concern about
      the uses to which baptismal records may be put, but it has broader application,
      particularly in relation to information resources which may be made available on the
      internet. There may be a need for a task force to look at this issue.<br>
    </li>
    <li>New ways of working together<br>
      The Committee welcomes proposals from the Financial Management and Development Committee,
      regarding the desirability of establishing a three-year budgeting cycle; and from Faith,
      Worship and Ministry, regarding collaboration in relation to the &quot;Jubilee.&quot; <br>
      <br>
