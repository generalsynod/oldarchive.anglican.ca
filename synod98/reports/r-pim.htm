<p>I. MANDATE</p>
</b>

<p>The Anglican Consultative Council, at its second meeting held in Dublin in 1973,
adopted the principles of Partners in Mission so that Anglican churches could consult and
share in God&#146;s mission within the larger communion. The following statement was
adopted:</p>
</font>

<table CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="498">
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP"><font size="3"><i>The responsibility for mission in any place belongs
    primarily to the church in that place. However, the universality of the gospel and the
    oneness of God&#146;s mission mean also that this mission must be shared in each and every
    place with fellow Christians from each and every part of the world with their distinctive
    insights and contributions.<p>If once we acted as though there were only givers who had
    nothing to receive and receivers who had nothing to give, the oneness of the missionary
    task must now make us all both givers and receivers.</i></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<font size="3">

<p>Since the Dublin meeting, there has developed throughout the Anglican Communion, a
common acceptance of what the Church&#146;s mission is as part of the mission of God. This
five-fold definition of mission, accepted by the Anglican Consultative Council in 1984,
reaffirmed in 1990, 1993 and again in 1996, is summarized as follows: 

<ul>
  <i>
  <li>To proclaim the Good News of the Kingdom </li>
  <li>To teach, baptize and nurture new believers.</li>
  <li>To respond to human need by loving service.</li>
  <li>To seek to transform unjust structures of society.</li>
  <li>To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation and sustain and renew the earth.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing this broad sense of mission and vocation for the Anglican Communion as a whole,
the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada in 1995 adopted a Strategic Plan which
chose as Priority A, to &quot;strengthen our mission and development partnerships outside
Canada.&quot; The Partners in Mission Committee has worked within this priority, under the
following mandate:</p>
</font>

<table CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="7" WIDTH="498">
  <tr>
    <td VALIGN="TOP"><font size="3"><i>To promote and develop mission, with enthusiasm and
    prayer, in a manner which engages the church in circles of partnership, locally,
    nationally, globally and ecumenically.</i></font></td>

<p>II. GENERAL POLICY AND OPERATIONS</p>
<i>

<p>Partners in Mission Committee</p>
</i></b>

<p>The Partners in Mission Committee had its first meeting in February/March of 1996,
together with all the other Standing Committees of General Synod. Since then, it has
followed the normal pattern of meeting twice a year, in September and February. The
Committee has 15 members, including 1 ecumenical member and 1 international member. In
this triennium, the ecumenical member has been the Rev. Troy Beretta of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in Canada. The international member has been The Most Rev. Glauco Soares
de Lima, Primate of the Igreja Episcopal Anglicana Do Brasil. In September of 1997, the
Committee accepted the invitation of one of its members, Nina Burnham, to meet on the Six
Nations Reserve, with a day added to the meeting to allow time to visit the Reserve and
learn about the issues facing indigenous Canadians.</p>

<p>The Committee did some of its work as a full plenary committee, and at other times
divided into three regional sub-committees (Africa/Middle East, Asia/Pacific, Latin
America/Caribbean) or two functional sub-committees (Mission Education, Overseas
Personnel). The report of each of these sub-committees follows.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Councils</p>
</b></i>

<p>As part of its mandate, the Committee took responsibility for overseeing our
church&#146;s relationships with the Canadian Council of Churches, the Anglican
Consultative Council and the World Council of Churches, all three of which have seen
significant changes in the past few years.</p>

<p>The Canadian Council of Churches welcomed the Roman Catholic Church as a full member in
1997, and in that same year, hired its first female General Secretary, Janet Somerville,
who is also a Roman Catholic. Our church&#146;s participation in the CCC was strengthened
by the election of Archbishop Barry Curtis as President of the Council.</p>

<p>Our church&#146;s representation on the Anglican Consultative Council has been
Archbishop Stewart Payne (bishop), the Rev. Barbara Clay (clergy) and Dr. Diane Maybee
(lay). Dr. Maybee&#146;s 9-year term concluded recently, and she has been replaced by Dr.
Stephen Toope. In 1996, the Rev. Canon David Hamid, former Regional Mission Coordinator
for Latin America/Caribbean, resigned from the General Synod staff to take up the position
of Ecumenical Officer for the Anglican Consultative Council.</p>

<p>The World Council of Churches is in the midst of major re-structuring and re-visioning.
Throughout this process, our church has been well represented on the Central Committee by
our Primate, Archbishop Michael Peers. In December of 1998, the Eighth Assembly of the WCC
will be held in Harare, Zimbabwe. Our church will send 5 official delegates, Ms. Alice
Jean Finlay, Rev. Dr. Wendy Fletcher-Marsh, Dr. Gail Cuthbert Brandt, Rev. Arthur
Anderson, Mr. Paul Hinton. In addition, 15 Canadian Anglicans will attend the Assembly as
&quot;Visitors&quot;.</p>

<p>The total budget in 1998 for our memberships in these 3 Councils, as well as the travel
funds to enable Canadian Anglicans to participate in meetings and gatherings of their
various commissions, committees and networks is $325,996. In addition, the Council of
General Synod has decided that each year, beginning in 1997, 10% of all undesignated
bequests received by the General Synod will be passed along to the Anglican Consultative
Council and the World Council of Churches.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Voluntary Mission Agencies</p>
</b></i>

<p>There continue to be yearly consultations with Voluntary Mission Agencies, in
accordance with the policy of 1988 governing relations between the General Synod and these
agencies. These consultations continue to be occasions of information-sharing and dialogue
about mission theology and practice. They are marked by a growing trust amongst the
participants.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Partners in Mission Consultations</p>
</b></i>

<p>The Anglican Church of Canada participated in only one Partners in Mission Consultation
since the last General Synod, with the Rev. Canon Ogé Beauvoir (staff) and the Rev. Canon
James Bennett (Diocese of Montreal) representing the Anglican Church of Canada at the
Province of West Africa PIM Consultation in Ghana. The Rev. Paul Kompass also attended,
representing the Companion Diocese relationship between the Diocese of Ontario and the
Diocese of Kumasi.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Staffing Changes</p>
</b></i>

<p>This past triennium saw many staffing changes. Partners in Mission staff were asked to
join with staff supporting the work of EcoJustice and the Anglican Council of Indigenous
Peoples, to form the Partnerships Department, with Dr. Ellie Johnson as Director. All
three of the former Regional Mission Coordinators resigned or retired and were replaced by
the Rev. Canon Ogé Beauvoir for Africa/Middle East, Dr. Andrea Mann for Asia/Pacific, the
Rev. Philip Wadham for Latin America/Caribbean. The Rev. Maylanne Maybee was hired as
Coordinator for Mission &amp; Justice Education, with half of her time devoted to Partners
in Mission and the other half to EcoJustice. Jill Cruse has continued as Coordinator of
Volunteers in Mission.</p>
<b>

<p>III. AFRICA / MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIPS</p>
<i>

<p>Background</p>
</i></b>

<p>Our partners in the region include the following: 

<ul>
  <li>13 autonomous ecclesiastical Anglican Provinces:</li>
</ul>

<p>Central Africa, Kenya, Southern Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, Congo, West
Africa, Sudan, Indian Ocean, the Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East; 

<ul>
  <li>9 ecumenical institutions:</li>
</ul>

<p>All Africa Conference of Churches, World Student Christian Federation, Project for
Christian Muslim Relations in Africa, Kgologano College, Formation Biblique et
Théologique à Maurice, Theological Education by Extension in Malawi, Association of
Christian Lay Centres in Africa, Christian Council of Ghana, Christian Churches Education
Association in Kenya; 

<ul>
  <li>2 Pan-African Anglican institutions:</li>
</ul>

<p>ANITEPAM (African Network of Institutions of Theological Education Preparing</p>

<p>Anglicans for Ministry) and CAPA (Council of Anglican Provinces of Africa).</p>

<p>The vastness of the change in Africa, the exploding growth of the church there in the
midst of extraordinary social, political and economic turmoil, the reality of our present
budget cutbacks, all these things require that we examine carefully what and where are to
be our appropriate partnership linkages for the future.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Priorities Of Our Partners</p>
</b></i>

<p>We agree with most of the partners that Theological Education is a priority in the
region. We continue to make regular grants to theological colleges and seminaries in West
Africa (St Nicholas), Tanzania ( St Mark&#146;s and St Cyprian&#146;s), Kenya ( St
Paul&#146;s United Theological College), Seychelles (St. Philip&#146;s), Uganda (Bishop
Tucker Theological College), Burundi (Institut Théologique de Matana) and Congo (ISThA -
Bunia). Meanwhile we continue to support Theological Education by Extension (TEE) in
Botswana, Malawi and Mauritius. We put some funds towards training programs for catechists
and evangelists in West Africa and Tanzania</p>

<p>Since the last General Synod meeting, we have established a formal partnership with
ANITEPAM (African Network of Institutions of Theological Education Preparing Anglicans for
Ministry). </p>

<p>Bursaries have enabled students to attend seminaries both in Africa and Canada, with
graduates from the latter serving now as bishops and seminary professors. Since the last
General Synod meeting, we have been able to sponsor 15 students from the region.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Support for Partners</p>
</b></i>

<p>Without any exaggeration we can say that the Africa / Middle East region is the fastest
growing part of the church in our world-wide Anglican Communion. There is an ongoing need
to support provinces and new dioceses. We make regular grants to provinces for basic
infrastructure needs, as well as assisting with all forms of necessary transport
(bicycles, motorcycles, vehicles) and supporting catechists, evangelists and new bishops
through training programs.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Ecumenical Partners</p>
</b></i>

<p>We continue our partnership with the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) which is
the most significant Pan-African ecumenical body. Half of our annual grant to AACC goes to
the International Affairs Desk which is playing a very important role in the peace and
reconciliation process across the continent. </p>

<p>We continue to be partners with the Association of Christian Lay Centres in Africa
(ACLA), and the Christian Churches Educational Association (CCEA).</p>

<p>Africa is a multi-faith continent (African Traditional Religion, Islam and
Christianity). The question of the rise of Islam remains an urgent one on the continent.
For this reason we value our partnership with PROCMURA (Project for Christian Muslim
Relations in Africa) in its training and teaching roles.</p>

<p>In Canada, we continue to do our Africa justice work ecumenically, through our
participation in the InterChurch Coalition on Africa, supported by both PIM and PWRDF.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Events of Significance Since Last General Synod</p>
</b></i>

<p>Our partnerships continue, both in breadth and depth. For your prayers of intercession
and of thanksgiving, here are just a few of the events which touched the lives of our
partners and of ourselves: 

<ul>
  <li>military coup in Sierra Leone;</li>
  <li>military coup and ethnic violence in Burundi;</li>
  <li>ethnic violence in Rwanda;</li>
  <li>continuing carnage in Algeria;</li>
  <li>change of regimes in Congo (ex-Zaire);</li>
  <li>end of war in Liberia;</li>
  <li>re-election of President D. arap Moi in Kenya;</li>
  <li>election of new Primates in the following Anglican Provinces: Southern Africa, Kenya,</li>
</ul>

<dir>
  <p>Church of Jerusalem &amp; the Middle East, and Rwanda;</p>
</dir>

<ul>
  <li>re-establishing church leadership in the Episcopal Church of Rwanda.</li>
</ul>
<i><b>

<p>Partnership</p>
</b></i>

<p>We are learning that partnership is about many things. Of course it is about the
sharing of financial resources, but that is only a small part of it. It is about <u>companionship
</u>(&quot;to eat bread with&quot;) and <u>compassion</u> (&quot;to suffer with&quot;),
and it is about this world in which our Lord entered and lived and loved and saved. It is
also about refugees, about inequities of the debt burden, about food and education and
shelter.</p>

<p>Our brothers and sisters in the Church in Africa are at the heart of the struggle for
those who seek the kind of life that God intended for His children. The cost to the Church
in Africa and to its leaders has always been and will continue to be very great. If we are
to be true partners, the cost must not be less for us.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Funding</p>
</b></i>

<p>In 1998, Partners in Mission has budgeted $404,792 for support of the mission work of
our partner churches in the Africa / Middle East Region.</p>
<b>

<p>IV. ASIA/PACIFIC PARTNERSHIPS</p>
<i>

<p>Background</p>
</i></b>

<p>The priority of the Asia/Pacific work of Partners in Mission continues to be the
building of mutual partnership for mission and justice between the Anglican Church of
Canada and our regional Anglican and ecumenical church partners. These partners include
Provinces and dioceses in the Council of the Church in East Asia (CCEA), including the
Episcopal Church of the Philippines, the Philippine Independent Church, the Anglican
Church of Korea, the new Anglican Province of South East Asia including the Dioceses of
Kuching, Sabah, Singapore and West Malaysia, and the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (Holy Catholic
Church of Japan); the Church of the Province of Myanmar; the two Anglican dioceses of the
Church of Ceylon (Sri Lanka); the Provinces and dioceses of the South Pacific Anglican
Council (SPAC), namely the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea, the Church of the Province
of Melanesia and the Diocese of Polynesia; the Church of North India; the China Christian
Council and the Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao; the Christian Conference of Asia (CCA),
the Pacific Conference of Churches, the ecumenical councils of churches in Korea, Japan,
the Philippines, Myanmar/Burma, India and Sri Lanka, and other Asian and Pacific
ecumenical organizations and institutions.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Priorities of Our Partners</p>
</b></i>

<p>Through mutual visits, correspondence and consultations, our Asia/Pacific partners
continue to affirm the priorities of theological education and leadership development,
evangelism, social justice and infrastructure development. As many of our partners also
live in situations of armed conflict, peacemaking and reconciliation have emerged as new
priorities in the last triennium.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Theological Education </p>
</b></i>

<p>We have tried to promote the development of local leadership in the region through
broad<b> </b>financial support of Asia/Pacific theological education and training of
personnel from Korea, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, India, Myanmar/Burma, Sri Lanka,
Papua New Guinea, Fiji and the Solomon Islands. Regional theological colleges which have
received support include St. Andrew&#146;s Seminary, Manila; the two regional seminaries
of the Philippine Independent Church, Aglipay Central Theological Seminary and St.
Paul&#146;s Regional Seminary; Bishop&#146;s College, Calcutta; Holy Cross Theological
College, Yangon; Theological College of Lanka, Sri Lanka; Newton Theological College,
Papua New Guinea; Bishop Patteson Theological College, Solomon Islands, and Pacific
Theological College, Fiji. We have also provided scholarship assistance to clergy and
laity from Burma, Korea, India, Sabah, and the Solomon Islands for graduate theological
studies at the Vancouver School of Theology, Wycliffe College, and Oxford University, UK.
We have facilitated the reappointment of the Rev. Canon John Blyth as a Volunteer In
Mission from the Diocese of New Westminster to the staff of Bishop Patteson Theological
College in the Solomon Islands. During their graduate theological studies, Revs. Margarite
Rhea, Lyn Oldale, and Katherine Greenfield participated in the cross-cultural student
internship program in the Philippines and India respectively.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Evangelism</p>
</b></i>

<p>Partners in Mission policy in the Asia/Pacific region continues to affirm the principle
that evangelism in Asia/Pacific is the mission of the church in that region. Our regional
Anglican and ecumenical are engaged in a variety of initiatives<b>, </b>such as church
renewal,<b> </b>parish development, lay ministry and popular theology. We have supported a
variety of activities in the Philippines, Burma, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka and the
Pacific. Canadian Volunteers in Mission, the Rev. Nelson Boon (Diocese of Quebec) in the
Diocese of Chubu in Japan and the Rev. Michael and Mrs. Norma Collier (Diocese of Nova
Scotia) in the Diocese of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, have also supported this work
during the last triennium.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Justice and Human Rights</p>
</b></i>

<p>Justice and human rights concerns continue to be a priority throughout the region. Many
of our Asia/Pacific partners suffer landlessness, poverty, denial of basic human rights,
violence, national division and frequent natural disasters. The situations in Burma, Sri
Lanka and the Philippines remain especially acute. </p>

<p>Ecumenical partners in Korea will this year mark the tenth anniversary of the Christian
Korean Declaration on National Peace and Reunification division of Korea. <u>Dalits</u>
(including Christian <u>dalits</u>) and <u>adavasi</u> (tribal people) in India are
beginning to demand justice from both church and society. (<u>Dalit</u>,
&quot;broken&quot; is the term by which India&#146;s most marginalized people, formerly
called the &quot;untouchables&quot; want to be known.). PIM supports the Ditt Memorial
Resource Centre in the Diocese of Amritsar, a Dalit program of education and
consciousness-raising.</p>

<p>We have also supported the women, youth and partnership desks of the Episcopal Church
of the Philippines; the Institute of Religion and Culture and other ecumenical
community-based justice programs in the Philippines; the human rights desks of the
National Councils of Churches in Korea, the Philippines and Sri Lanka; research programs
in the Philippines and Sri Lanka; gender awareness training by the World Student Christian
Federation (Asia/Pacific) in Hong Kong and the Asian Women&#146;s Resource Centre for
Culture and Theology, Malaysia; and church publications in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Burma. </p>

<p>Much of our Asia social justice work is done ecumenically through our PIM and
PWRDF-supported coalition, the Canada Asia Working Group (CAWG). Through CAWG we have been
involved in justice concerns in countries where we do not have Anglican church partners,
such as Indonesia and East Timor. In 1997, the Year of Asia Pacific in which Canada hosted
the 5th annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, PIM supported the work
of CAWG and the South Pacific People&#146;s Association of Canada&#146;s (SPPFC) in their
advocacy for justice in issues relating to the impact of trade globalization on culture,
traditional economies and occupations, and the environment in Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Peace and Reconciliation</p>
</b></i>

<p>Peace and reconciliation have continued as a priority in the last three years. We have
supported the peace process between the Philippines government and the National Democratic
Front. Through CAWG and our South Korean church partners, we have continued to support the
reunification of Korea and maintained relations with the emerging Protestant and Roman
Catholic churches in North Korea. We have also continued to support peace and
reconciliation in Sri Lanka, and to work with the Churches in Myanmar/Burma toward full
democracy.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Partnership</p>
</b></i>

<p>Mission is about people and building partnership relations. In the last three years,
there have been many visits back and forth between the Anglican Church of Canada and
Anglican churches and ecumenical organizations in the region. Companion diocese
relationships exist between the Dioceses of Nova Scotia and Port Moresby (Papua New
Guinea), the Dioceses of Qu&#146;Appelle ,West Malaysia and Lichfield, the Dioceses of
Calgary and Temotu (Melanesia) and the Diocese of British Columbia and the Church of the
Province of Myanmar. The Diocese of Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador is currently in an
ecumenical companionship with the United Church of Canada, the Presbyterian Church in
Canada and the Diocese of Jabalpur, Church of North India (post-denominational).</p>

<p>Partnership has also, until December 1996, been expressed ecumenically through the
Canada China Program, whereby we joined with other Canadian churches in relating with the
China Christian Council and the Catholic Church in China. PIM is currently exploring
renewed ecumenical partnership with the China Christian Council. With the United and
Presbyterian Churches of Canada, we also relate ecumenically with the Church of North
India (CNI) General Synod, dioceses and CNI organizations.</p>

<p>The Anglican Church of Canada&#146;s relationships with Anglican churches and
ecumenical organizations and institutions in the Asia/Pacific are rich and deep. In the
spirit of Partners in Mission we have both given and received. Although our declining
financial resources are a concern, as there is still a need for financial support in many
places, we have prayers, friendship, community life, concern and solidarity to offer. Our
partners in Asia and the Pacific also have many of these gifts to offer to us.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Funding</p>
</b></i>

<p>In 1998, Partners in Mission has budgeted $333,004 for support of the mission work of
our partners churches in the Asia/Pacific Region.</p>
<b>

<p>V. LATIN AMERICA/CARIBBEAN</p>
<i>

<p>Background</p>
</i></b>

<p>The region is vast and diverse: about 35 independent states and a handful of dependent
colonial territories with countries ranging in size from small Caribbean islands to the
vastness of Brazil. The Anglican/Episcopal presence consists of some long established
Provinces (Brazil, Cono Sur and the West Indies) as well as the new autonomous Provinces
of Mexico (1995) and Central Region of the Americas (January 1998). Cuba, Puerto Rico,
Venezuela and Bermuda continue to be extra-Provincial dioceses. Our key ecumenical
partnerships are with the CLAI (Latin American Council of Churches), the CCC (Caribbean
Conference of Churches), the CONIC (National Council of Churches of Brazil), and the CEC
(Cuban Ecumenical Council).</p>
<i><b>

<p>Priorities For The Region</p>
</b></i>

<p>Our partnership is developed through consultation with the dioceses/provinces in the
region. These consultations have identified the following priorities: education for both
clergy and lay people in areas of Biblical studies, theology and the practice of ministry;
evangelism and missionary expansion; justice-making; infrastructure/material resources.
The examples below give a flavour of the depth and breadth of the Anglican Church of
Canada&#146;s mission partnership support.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Education for Clergy and Lay People</p>
</b></i>

<p>There is a growing realization in the global Anglican/Episcopal communion that
leadership needs to be shared between clergy and lay people. This is reflected in Latin
America/Caribbean regional priorities. Support for the education of ordinands and priests
is through national and regional, Episcopal and ecumenical theological institutions in
Barbados, Costa Rica, Cuba, Brazil, Haiti and Argentina. Payments are made in the form of
scholarships awarded to individuals or as core funding to the institution. Of these
institutions the oldest in the region, Codrington College, Barbados now accepts students
whose linguistic background is not English. An accredited theological college working on
the North American credit system, it is in conversation with Canadian seminaries with a
view to encouraging short-term student placements at Codrington. It is also active in lay
education for the Diocese of Barbados. Lay education for ministry is high on the agenda in
a number of dioceses. One excellent example of this is the Diocese of the Windward
Islands. In St. Vincent a new diocesan centre will be the home of an education program
that is part funded by Anglican Church of Canada Partnerships. The program has been in
place since the fall of 1996 and the 25 students who are involved in it speak
enthusiastically of its benefits to them and the church. In all these institutions and
programs, both for clergy and lay people, the Anglican/Episcopal church does not shrink
from discussing the significant questions of &#145;context&#146; and
&#145;enculturation&#146; as they relate to the mission of the Church. </p>
<i><b>

<p>Evangelism and Missionary Expansion</p>
</b></i>

<p>Secularism in Latin America and the Caribbean is growing in this pluralistic region. In
Latin America where the Roman Catholic Church has traditionally been the dominant church,
fundamentalist groups have made an impact in several countries. Increasingly the Anglican
Church is giving attention to evangelism with some success. With an emphasis on shared
leadership and decision making, a sound theological and Biblical base, the centrality of
the Eucharist and a commitment to social concern, Anglican Churches commend themselves to
many people and the church in various parts of Latin America and the Caribbean is growing.
This growth requires support from partners in many ways, including personnel, purchase of
land, education material and, of course, prayer.</p>

<p>South-South personnel appointments continue to be encouraged. In Uruguay the S-S
appointee (Miguel Tamayo from Cuba) is now the new Bishop of Uruguay. There is a proposal
for one or two S-S missionary worker(s) on the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and
Martinique with joint funding from the Episcopal Church of the US and the Anglican Church
of Canada.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Justice Making</p>
</b></i>

<p>Support is constantly needed for programs which might not find funding locally because
they deal with very sensitive or unpopular issues, but which, nevertheless, are part of
the Church&#146;s prophetic mission. The rights of minorities, education around AIDS,
addressing the situation of street children, and involvement in questions of national
reconciliation, etc., are normal outgrowths of the Church&#146;s mission, and Anglicans in
the region work closely with ecumenical partners and councils in this work.</p>

<p>In Canada, we continue to do our Latin America justice work ecumenically, through our
participation in the InterChurch Committee on Human Rights in Latin America, supported by
both PIM and PWRDF.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Infrastructure/Material Resources</p>
</b></i>

<p>In this region where, like much of the world, the gap between the rich and the poor
continues to grow, our Church partners seek to serve the poorest of the poor. In order to
do this effectively the Church, following the example of St. Paul (I Cor: 16) asks its
more affluent brothers and sisters in Canada to be a part of their program of social
concern. In this respect Canadian funding has been used for various projects: land
purchase, community centres, local relief. Though the amount of money that we are able to
send towards such work is limited it stands as a sign of our commitment to each other,
brothers and sisters, companions in the body of Christ </p>
<i><b>

<p>Events, Anglican and Otherwise, of Note in the Region 

<ul>
  </b></i>
  <li>The visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba during which he called for: a peaceful transition
    to more freedom in the country; was critical of an unquestioned buying-in to the
    neo-liberal economic order; and for an end to the economic embargo against Cuba directed
    by the US.</li>
  <li>In Uruguay the election of the Reverend Miguel Tamayo as the Bishop of Uruguay. He and
    his wife Marta have been working in Uruguay as South-South Partners in Mission from Cuba
    since February 1995</li>
  <li>The passing of a &quot;Religious Freedom Bill&quot; in Chile that guarantees equal
    treatment before the law of all religious denominations and groups. </li>
  <li>Peace accords signed in Guatemala and El Salvador that officially bring to an end many
    years of armed conflict between government forces and nationalist guerrilla groups.
    Notwithstanding this, the struggle for a just, equitable society continues with little
    sign that this is being achieved. (See the video &quot;Peace: What Peace&quot; produced by
    the Inter Church Committee [1997] on Human Rights in Latin America [ICCHRLA] and available
    from the Anglican Church of Canada Resource Centre).</li>
  <li>The formation of a new ecclesiastical province in Central America in January 1998 that
    consists of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.</li>
  <li>The sixth assembly of the Caribbean Conference of Churches in July 1997, held in Havana,
    Cuba. It was a &#145;crisis&#146; assembly that met to discuss and approve a new way of
    being the Caribbean Council of Churches at a time of massive external funding cut-backs.
    The Caribbean Council of Churches now operates on an annual budget that is 10% of what it
    was receiving during its hey-day.</li>
  <li>&#145;Experience&#146; visits by groups of Canadian Anglicans (predominantly young
    people) to the Anglican Church in Guyana and Belize.</li>
  <li>The Anglican/Episcopal Church in some countries becoming more indigenised in the sense
    of claiming an identity of its own rather that remaining dependent for its identity on
    other parts of the communion.</li>
</ul>
<i><b>

<p>Final Reflections</p>
</b></i>

<p>In a recent conversation with the Primate of the Episcopal Province of Brazil, the Most
Reverend Dom Glauco Soares de Lima, who has been an external partner for the Partners in
Mission Committee since last General Synod, he talked about the need to personalise the
partnership that we have as Anglicans. What he meant by that was the presence in his
diocese of Anglicans from other parts of the communion for both brief and longer periods
of time. As he further described it, &quot;We need some warm Canadian bodies with us to
share in our experiences&quot;. At a Diocesan Consultation in Algoma, a diocese in
companion relationship with the Windward Islands, the same point was made. The promoters
had in mind a two-way interchange of personnel between the dioceses, again for varying
lengths of time. The history of missionary work of the Anglican Church of Canada has moved
from a time of sending personnel to serve overseas for periods of three or more years to a
time where, as a response to a different view of mission very few people from Canada are
to be found working in Latin America and the Caribbean. It seems from the comments above
that we are at a time when the Anglican Church should encourage a strategy that allows for
the best of both those approaches in its mission abroad. A healthy development is the
growing number of short-term exposure trips for church groups that allow a glimpse of
another Anglican&#146;s reality. Though we no longer have the funds at the national level
to place salaried people overseas for lengthy periods of time, other programmes, like
Volunteers In Mission, do afford an opportunity for work outside of Canada. What is less
common is the practice of Canadian dioceses offering a similar experience in Canada to our
partners overseas. It is to be hoped that our Partnership programme will increasingly
allow for such two-way interchange and that the initiative for this will be as much that
of the dioceses as of the General Synod office. We are, after all, a part of the one
Anglican/Episcopal communion, brothers and sisters together in Christ. </p>

<p>Funding</p>
</b></i>

<p>In 1998 Partners in Mission has budgeted $301,889 for support of the mission work of
our partner churches in the Latin America/Caribbean Region</p>
<b>

<p>VI. VOLUNTEERS IN MISSION AND OTHER OVERSEAS PERSONNEL</p>
<i>

<p>Volunteers In Mission </p>
</i></b>

<p>The Volunteers In Mission Program of the Anglican Church of Canada was approved at the
Winnipeg General Synod in 1986. The first appointments were made in late 1988 and early
1989 to Fiji and Tanzania. Since that time 64 adults and 13 children have served as
Volunteers In Mission and returned to Canada. 14 are presently serving with partner
churches or institutions in 7 countries, and 6 more are preparing to leave in 1998.
Volunteers have come from 17 of our 30 dioceses, from BC to Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>The joint program with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada continued until 1993
at which time the ELCIC decided to move it&#146;s program operation to their national
headquarters in Winnipeg. The Anglican Church of Canada continues to provide health
insurance coverage for ELCIC VIM under our master policy with Mutual of Omaha and both
programs continue to consult and learn from one another.</p>

<p>Volunteers are required to form a support group in their local area whose functions are
to provide moral and spiritual support and to raise the funds needed to cover the costs of
such things as return airfare, health insurance and a modest monthly living allowance.
Experience has shown this is quite possible and allows qualified volunteers to serve with
minimal cost to the General Synod budget.</p>

<p>Volunteers are also required to participate in a cross-cultural Orientation Conference
designed and delivered by the Canadian Churches Forum for Global Ministries. This is a
well planned event, ecumenical for both participants and presenters and gives a solid
grounding for the volunteers to draw on during their placement overseas. Returned
volunteers participate in a Re-Entry to Canada Conference which is designed to assist them
to integrate and use their experience in their continuing ministry at home. </p>

<p>We participate in the Forum for Global Ministries through an annual grant and by
membership on the Board and the curriculum committee of the Forum. </p>

<p>The VIM program is a vehicle for mission education within the church here in Canada.
Parishes and dioceses are closely connected to the volunteers and their learnings and
experiences. Letters and newsletters sent home by the volunteers are circulated by their
support group within the parish and to diocesan groups. Some dioceses include letters from
the volunteers in their diocesan paper. Volunteers return home greatly enriched and
committed to sharing what their experiences have taught them. Their support group assists
them, as needed, in arranging opportunities within their diocese to do so. </p>

<p>The PIMC initiated a Program Evaluation of Volunteers in Mission in 1997, when the
program was 10 years old. The purpose of the review is: &quot;to assess the effectiveness
of the Volunteers In Mission Program against the goals of the program and our
church&#146;s wider goals of partnership and mission. The first draft of the report was
received by PIMC in March, 1998 with a final report and recommendations to be ready for
the fall 1998 meeting of the Council of General Synod. Such issues as appropriate
recognition of volunteers, using the VIM program for receiving missioners from our partner
churches and developing in-Canada placements for VIM are be reviewed by the evaluator. </p>

<p>Goals for the next triennium are to act on the recommendations of the VIM evaluation
and to maintain a participant level which ensures the quality of the program placements.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Overseas Personnel</p>
</b></i>

<p>This form of overseas staffing, where missioners were paid entirely from the
Apportionment budget, has been phased out in favour of the Volunteers In Mission model.
The last missioner on a General Synod salary was the Rev. Canon Ogé Beauvoir from the
Diocese of Montreal, who served in Haiti until July, 1996, when he returned to Canada to
take up his current position as Regional Mission Coordinator for Africa/Middle East on the
staff of General Synod.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Overseas Summer Student Internship Program</p>
</b></i>

<p>The goals of the program are: 

<ul>
  <li>To increase awareness of global concerns among theological students.</li>
  <li>To increase students&#146; commitment to our church&#146;s mission and ministry.</li>
  <li>To give prospective clergy who have not lived in a developing country an experience of
    the third world.</li>
</ul>

<p>This program was piloted in 1992 with the placement of one student in Belize. This
pilot placement received a very positive evaluation and Partners in Mission Committee has
continued the program. Seventeen students have participated in summer international
internships since the program began. In 1996, 5 students were placed in the Philippines,
Belize, the Dominican Republic, India and Uganda. In 1997 one intern served in the Diocese
of West Ankole in the Church of Uganda and in 1998 there will be three students serving in
St. Vincent, Church of the Province of the West Indies, in the Diocese of Cape Coast,
Ghana, and in the Diocese of Seychelles, Church of the Province of the Indian Ocean. </p>
<i><b>

<p>Funding</p>
</b></i>

<p>In 1998, Partners in Mission has budgeted $40,800 for the recruitment, selection,
orientation and re-entry of volunteers and for the administration of the Volunteers in
Mission Program -. Funds to support individual volunteers are raised in parishes and
dioceses across Canada, almost $175,000 in 1997. The 1998 budget for the Overseas Student
Internship Program is $18,500.</p>
<b>

<p>VII. MISSION EDUCATION, INTERPRETATION, AND RESOURCES</p>
<i>

<p>Companion Diocese Program</p>
</i></b>

<p>The Companion Diocese program has proven to be an effective way of giving context and
personality to our mission partnerships throughout the Anglican Communion. Many Canadian
dioceses entered into companionships through friendships formed among bishops at Lambeth
1988. They were most successful when there was energy and commitment from both parties in
the companionship. Over the past decade, several companionships were renewed, and are now
being concluded. As a result, there is increased interest in forming new companionships,
often with a preference for a diocese that is closer to home, not too expensive to travel
to, and where there is facility to communicate in English. A tall order!! There are
currently 18 Canadian dioceses linked with international partner dioceses, and 4 more
seeking such links. One Diocese, Eastern Newfoundland and Labrador, is joining with local
partners from the United and Presbyterian Churches in an innovative companionship with the
post-denominational Church of North India. </p>
<i><b>

<p>Making the Connections III</p>
</b></i>

<p>A third gathering of 62 Anglicans involved in the mission and development education
work of Partners in Mission and the Primate&#146;s World Relief and Development Fund was
held at Geneva Park in May 1996. Some Diocesan representatives involved in social justice
and supporting the work of the EcoJustice Committee attended, but representation was
limited as they had not yet had a chance to meet on their own. The success of these events
is growing, and there are plans for a <i>Connections IV</i> in 1999.</p>
<i><b>

<p>People Exchange Program</p>
</b></i>

<p>This program enables church partners from overseas to come to Canada as resource people
who can help personalise and give a face to our mission partnerships. It also supports
returned Canadian mission personnel to travel internally as resource people in mission
education. Over the last 3 years, the program has brought 25 overseas visitors to Canada,
and supported 4 Canadians to visit other dioceses to share their experience and learnings.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Partnership Visits</p>
</b></i>

<p>The other dimension of personalising mission partnerships is to offer opportunities to
Canadian Anglicans to make short term visits to overseas partner churches. This program
has made it possible for 14 visits from more than half a dozen dioceses and organizations
to every region of the Anglican Communion. The program supports exchanges between
Companion Dioceses, helps personnel from voluntary mission societies to respond to
invitations from overseas partners, and enables Canadian Anglicans to participate in study
tours or conferences. </p>
<i><b>

<p>Mission Education Network</p>
</b></i>

<p>Additional staffing has made it possible to develop and strengthen this network for
sharing information and ideas about mission and our mission partnerships. Contact people
have been recruited in 22 out of 30 dioceses. They have been given job descriptions to
help clarify their role as both givers and disseminators of information within their
diocese about mission activities of the Anglican Church of Canada. One challenge is to
coordinate and not duplicate other networking initiatives, for example by the
Primate&#146;s World Relief and Development Fund or the Ten Days for Global Justice
coalition. Some dioceses have PWRDF and Partners in Mission contact people who work in a
team. This seems to be a good model and worth building on. Another challenge is to
complement information about the mission work of the national church with that of
voluntary mission societies.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Resources</p>
</b></i>

<p>Changes in structure, staffing, and budget resulting from the Strategic Plan have also
changed what mission education resources are produced and how often. <i>Ministry Matters</i>,
now published three times a year, is the major vehicle for spreading information and
stories about mission partnerships and volunteers in mission. Short stories about work of
our partners which our funds support regularly appear in the Anglican Appeal publication,<i>
Update</i>. A new joint brochure between PWRDF and Partners in Mission has recently been
produced, outlining shared principles of partnership and the distinctive aspects of each
area of work. Other resources are produced more informally to support inter-diocesan
networking. These include occasional mailings of a &quot;newsy letter about mission
education&quot; and a binder with guidelines, information and ideas to support Companion
Diocese committees.</p>
<i><b>

<p>Funding</p>
</b></i>

<p>In 1998, Partners in Mission has budgeted $45,000 for Mission Education, Interpretation
and Resources.</p>
<b>

<p>VIII FUTURE DIRECTIONS</p>
</b>

<p>The Partners in Mission Committee, and its predecessors, the Partners in World Mission
Committee and before that the World Mission Subcommittee, have worked for many years under
the Anglican Communion&#146;s understanding of partnership in mission, as articulated by
the Toronto Congress of 1963 (Mutual Responsibility and Interdependence in the Body of
Christ, known as MRI), and by the Anglican Consultative Council at its second meeting in
Dublin (the Partners in Mission Process). The current Strategic Plan of General Synod,
which has called for a strengthening of our church&#146;s international mission and
development partnerships, coupled with the coincidental arrival of new staff responsible
for our international mission work, has given the PIMC the opportunity to view the work
with new eyes and listen with new ears. This has resulted in a new awareness of the
disturbingly slow progress we have made towards the goals of MRI and PIM, as defined by
the Anglican Consultative Council. The PIMC, therefore, will urge the next committee to
give substantial attention to the problem of dependency in mission relationships, and to
the need to deepen the quality of mutuality with our mission partners, perhaps even
abandoning the term &quot;partnership&quot; in favour of a term which might better reflect
our vision of healthy mission relationships. The PIMC has requested the Anglican
Consultative Council to engage the whole Communion in an examination and discussion of
these matters. </p>
