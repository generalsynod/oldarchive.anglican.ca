<p>Developments to March &#145;98: 

<ul>
  </b></font><font SIZE="2">
  <li>A thorough review of all the responses and archival materials related to Hearing Diverse
    Voices was Undertaken including a diocese by diocese summary. As a result of that review
    several courses of action were proposed. Consideration was given to how to respond to
    criticisms of the study, especially with regard to the areas which attracted the most
    severe criticism, namely the section on the biblical materials and on the nature of
    ethical reflection.</li>
  <li>Six biblical scholars were approached to submit written comments on the biblical section
    with suggestions for what changes, if any, should be made. The responses were appreciative
    of the attempt to be even handed but most felt that that in the attempt to be even handed
    the diversity of voices was lost. It was decided to ask a small group of the scholars
    representing some of that diversity to contribute separate pieces that could be edited
    into a dialogue. This work continues.</li>
  <li>Recognizing the need for the dialogue to have a stronger grass roots base we have
    requested through CoGS that diocese set up inclusive diocesan commissions to discuss
    issues of sexuality. We have offered to provide support in facilitating these groups and
    have offered to coordinate the sharing of information from such commissions. 8 dioceses
    have responded to the request to establish commissions on sexuality; one has declined,
    while the others have named a contact person. Two more dioceses are in conversation with
    the staff about the process.</li>
  <li>Eric has been engaged in several clergy days and in Diocesan and Parish discussions on
    homosexuality.</li>
  <li>The House of Bishops has issued a new statement revising their 1979 Guidelines (Eric
    provided staff assistance to the task group). The facts that staff assistance was provided
    from FWM to the House&#146;s task group and that the House decided to discuss these issues
    in open session have helped to improve communication between the House and this committee
    which we hope will be ongoing. </li>

    heterosexual marriage and same sex unions to be proposed for study in the Church, with

Committee (NCMLC) and the (CCJC) Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation.</p>

<ul>
  </font><font SIZE="2">
  <li>With the Canadian Christian Jewish Consultation, and several other interfaith and
    ecumenical partners, we participated in a meeting with the then Justice Minister Alan Rock
    on the governments activity with regard to suspected war criminals. At that meeting a
    statement was released by the Primate.</li>
  <li>We have participated in the organization of several seminars with CCJC and most recently
    participated in a seminar which included CCJC and the NCMLC. This was the first time there
    would be a common event among these groups.</li>
  <li>The CCJC has provided a forum for the consideration of policies being developed by
    ourselves and our partner churches. Currently there is a discussion of the United Church
    of Canada Document, <i>Bearing Faithful Witness</i>.</li>
  <li>With the NCMLC we have participated in the organization of an annual dinner meeting to
    honour those who have made outstanding contributions to Muslim Christian Relations. The
    first dinner honoured the work of Wilfred Cantwell-Smith and Tahir Aziz.</li>
  <li>There has been some discussion with regard to how the NCMLC might be enabled to be more
    genuinely national in its representation. One of the difficulties relates to how
    appointments are made to the NCMLC and how the structures work in the various faith
    bodies.</li>
  <li>The Interfaith Commission of the Canadian Council of Churches has met several times and
    is seeking to redefine its role. It is an important forum for ecumenical planning for
    interfaith activity and a useful context in which to attempt to expand interfaith
    involvement ecumenically and at the national level.</li>
  <li>Several Anglicans have participated in the North American Interfaith Network
    Conferences. The most recent was in Columbia, SC. The next will be held in Edmonton in
    August. The committee has been exploring involvements with the WCRP and with the
    Parliament of the World&#146;s Religions. Both bodies will have major international
    meetings in 1999. </li>
  <li>There is some concern about the need to engage interfaith issues at the grass roots
    level, and to maintain the lines of communication between national dialogues and local
    initiatives. </li>

theology of communion. It is moving on to:</p>

  <li>Christology (Christ&#146;s nature and the Church), </li>
  <li>the structure and order of the Church (treated both as theological and practical): </li>

  <li>Euthanasia</u>: The task force met several times during the triennium. We gathered data
    from our ecumenical partners and from other parts of the Anglican Communion. A draft
    statement was prepared with the recommendation that the statement be adopted as a policy
    statement of the Anglican Church of Canada. A more substantial report entitled, &quot;Care
    in Dying&quot; was produced providing background to the task group&#146;s research and
    conclusions. Both the draft statement and the report were forwarded to CoGS with the
    request that they be commended to General Synod.</li>
  <u>
  <li>Biotechnologies</u> Following requests for information from the Department of
    Agriculture and Fisheries the FWM Committee concluded that significant ethical issues are
    raised by the increased prominence of biotechnologies in agriculture and pharmaceuticals,
    which are likely to be ongoing for the foreseeable future. FWM supported by Ecojustice
    requested CoGS to establish a joint task group to reflect on these issues. </li>
  <li>Requests for information have been received relating to changes in procedures for the
    procurement of organs for transplantation, and in the area of <u>New Reproductive and
    Genetic Technologies</u>. Discussion of these issues suggested the need both for some
    immediate response and for long term strategy.</li>
  <li>One issue for immediate response was the issue of the <u>cloning of human persons</u>.
    The FWM committee noted that despite the widespread agreement that there should be a
    moratorium on human cloning at this time, there were some in the scientific community who
    had expressed their intention to proceed. While this does not represent the position of
    the mainstream scientific community, the suggestion that free trade areas may provide a
    means to bypass any moratorium raises real concerns about whether such moratoria can
    create the needed space for public debate and consultation before any developments in this
    area. These concerns also point to the international dimensions of this problem and the
    need to engage these issues at the level of the Communion. In view of this, and the speed
    with which new developments could emerge, a motion is proposed to General Synod.</li>
  <li>For long term response FWM has suggested that a task group be set up within the Anglican
    Church of Canada on NRGTs and also that we seek to work with our ecumenical and interfaith
    partners as this is likely to lead to a more coordinated and productive response to
    Government requests for responses from the faith communities.</li>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developments to March &#145;98: </b></font><font SIZE="3">Some 15
Anglican biblical scholars were invited to evaluate the Contemporary English Version as a
translation and for public reading in worship. Responses range from reserved to highly
critical. Some believed that the intention of achieving simplicity has sometimes led the
translators to obscure the text or to remove nuances and references. One identified many
inaccuracies, especially in highly theological passages. The concept of translating by
&#145;dynamic equivalence&#146; has been followed, but it deprives the reader of being
able to deal with the ambivalence of the original terms. A summary of the responses was
sent to the House of Bishops; the Committee proposed that the CEV not be recommended for
public worship and that caution should be exercised with engaging in private study of it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Faith Worship and Ministry agreed to invite a group of representative
Canadian Anglican Biblical scholars to serve as a committee of reference to evaluate
translations of Scripture for use in public worship and personal study; to submit
significant new translations of Scripture to the committee of reference and to report its
conclusions from time to time to the House of Bishops.</p>
