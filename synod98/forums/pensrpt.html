<b>MEMO TO:	Pension Committee</b><p>
<b>FROM:		Jim Boyles, General Secretary</b><p>
<b>RE:			Comments from Forums at General Synod</b><p>
<b>____________________________________________________</b><p>
The  following comments were recorded on newsprint and relate to the work of
your committee:<p>
<b>Care for Church Employees (From <i>New Ways of Working Forum)</i></b><p>
Concerns<p>
*	Sask. must pay first $850 for drugs before government plan kicks in.<p>
*	Establish extended health and dental for all retirees - some dioceses not
covered currently (W. Nfld have outside carriers and others)<p>
*	absence of consultative process when changes made to benefits (sometimes)<p>
*	concern re environments that lead to "excess" number of stress claims under
LTD plan<p>
*	ACPO process/standards should receive periodic review as times change<p>
*	better mechanism to permit clergy to take sabbaticals<p>
<b>Interim and Part-time Employees (From <i>New Ways of Working
Forum)</i></b><p>
*	more support for part-time <p>
a) continuing education<p>
b) supervision<p>
c) covenant and guidelines<p>
* not a way to get cheap ministry - is more prone to abuse but  has much to
commend it<p>
*	interim ministry - "trained" specialized natinally?<p>
*	perform a special function different from maintenance ministry.<p>
<b>Shape of Future Ministry (From <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>
1.	Usage of local people<p>
*	team ministry where lay and ordained work together<p>
2.	Team needs outside guidance and coordination (sic) / supervision<p>
*	i.e. Paul's letters to the churches<p>
3.	Vision for lay involvement - requirement of certain standards - so that
individuals would have a foundation<p>
4.	Discernment process  - Asking parish to identify those individuals who are
qualified and accepted to take on these roles for ministry.<p>
5.	Develop ministry development coordinator.
