<b>MEMO TO:	Eco-Justice Committee</b><p>
<b>FROM:		Jim Boyles, General Secretary</b><p>
<b>RE:			Comments from Forums at General Synod</b><p>
<b>____________________________________________________</b><p>
The following comments were recorded on newsprint and relates to the work of
your committee:<p>
<p>
<b><u>TOWARD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY </u></b><p>
.	We must understand exactly what sustainable community is on a local level.<p>
.	Our local communities are out of balance in many ways:<br>- depletion of
natural resources<br>- unemployment (and consequently migration)<br>- lack of
togetherness on a community level e.g. helping each other.<p>
.	The church needs to promote its <u>vision</u> on community and the care of
the earth - what is the "good life"<p>
.	Partnership with local churches and other national churches.<p>
.	Biblical/spiritual foundation for community action.<p>
.	Developing partnerships with governments.  Example: working guaranteed annual
income.<p>
.	Pairing North/South churches.<p>
.	Compassion for refugees and economic migrants.<p>
<b><u>GAMBLING</u></b><p>
.	Can we work ecumenically on this issue?  In parishes, dioceses and national
level.<p>
.	Educational materials needed:<br>- theological reflection: greed,
materialism, happiness<br>- study programs - resource kit<p>
.	Vigilance in pointing out human costs of gambling - costs to community and
family life<p>
<b><u>MAKING MORAL ECONOMIC DECISIONS</u></b><p>
.	Moral economic decisions begin with personal commitment to the personal
decisions we can control.<p>
.	Equip church people to be a moral conscience in their workplace.<p>
<b><u>FOOD BANKS </u></b><p>
.	Generally: a huge, complex international issue!  <p>
.	Food banks and government funding --&gt; NO!<p>
.	Government support for potentially addictive activities and substances is
[arrowup]rising while funding for social programs is [arrowdown]declining.<p>
.	The church and church members should lobby (e.g. letters) to governments and
consider carefully when choosing to support a party.<p>
	<u>What can the Churches do?</u><p>
.	Education - nutrition, money management, food purchasing and preparation<p>
.	Providing information, educating parishes about need<p>
.	Using our gifts and resources (e.g. space) to respond.<p>
.	Need for food banks and our response to them is a faith issue.<p>
.	Individual involvement needs a personal contact and connection.<p>
.	Food banks are not needed in small Newfoundland communities who help each
other but are found in St. John's area.<p>
.	Addressing the problem requires a dual approach - hands on help and advocacy
for change.<p>
.	Depression of 30's showed need for society's involvement and brought
government action - we have short term memories.<p>
.	What is the difference between the Lion's Club and a church delivering a
turkey? It's a faith issue.<p>
.	Help is needed in helping parish renew their faith led support for those in
need.<p>
.	What about committed "vowed" societies to engage in exemplary ministries?
E.g. with a rule of life showing service as a prominent commitment.<p>
.	Church dialogue with governments (provincial and federal) appears to be
largely unheard.<p>
.	Investigate the model for community pastoral ministry with Sue Taylor of
Carlington Chaplaincy in Ottawa.<p>
<b><u>ROYAL COMMISSION ON ABORIGINAL PEOPLE</u></b><p>
.	Visibility - varies from highly visible to areas where there are no
indigenous people in churches.  Particularly in cities there are indigenous
people not connected to church or home communities.<p>
.	Awareness - the responsibility is personal awareness and action begins with
each of us living our lives as Christians where we are.<p>
<b><u>JUBILEE - A CELEBRATION OF HOPE </u> (From <i>Streams of Living Justice
Forum)</i></b><p>
.	The church needs to announce Jubilee as Jesus did as a celebration.  We need
to present HOPE to parishioners.<p>
.	We <u>are</u> the church - what can we do?<p>
.	When Jesus proclaimed Jubilee he was more concerned about our salvation out
of which Justice will come.  Is the church in danger of standing outside and
being the ombudsman?<p>
.	The church could/should make expectations and be prophetic in our
relationships and demands of national and international financial
organizations.<p>
.	The members of the church need to understand the full implication of Jubilee
for themselves and need to help each other to achieve the Jubilee by changing
lifestyles and assisting others internationally, nationally and corporately to
change their ways. (Resources, education, goals and objectives, prayer).<p>
<b>JUBILEE (From<i> Partnerships Forum)</i></b><p>
<b><i>To what extent and in what ways do you think the priorities for the work
of the Partners in Mission Committee and the PWRDF Committee do or should
reflect the themes of Jubilee?</i></b><p>
*	Need a good theological reflection on the meaning of Jubilee - bible study
material<p>
*	Practical ways to practice Jubilee - 1st question, `what do we let go of?'<p>
*	Importance of Sabbath renewed<p>
*	Maintain arm lengths with government agencies<p>
*	How would debt forgiveness work at all levels?<p>
*	Balance of debt forgiveness and human rights<p>
*	Means of accountability with debt forgiveness<p>
*	Tie debt forgiveness to restorative justice<p>
*	Willing to find ways to take a prophetic voice locally in specific ways <p>
*	Dioceses finding ways of `letting go'<p>
*	Jubilee service to heal brokenness, starting with ourselves and process<p>
*	Recognition of forgiveness<p>
*	Being in partnership with those in debt / in prison<p>
<b>Jubilee (from<i> Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- Sabbath begins with hearing what each of means by Sabbath<p>
- Let us not confuse commercial celebration of millennium with Jubilee<p>
- set aside time of Sabbath each day for the next 3 years (2001)<p>
- do the givers understand the concept of - land, freedom, slavery, celebrating
Sabbath<p>
- We need to work with other ecumenical/inter-faith groups around the
categories in 4<p>
<b><u>DEBT CANCELLATION</u></b><p>
*	We agree with the campaign but believe it will be a "hard go" and "hard sell"
in one parishes and in the context of our society because of attitudes, fear,
and enormity of the issues and amounts of $, understanding of the other's
reality, locus of power.<p>
*	Forgiveness is an act of self interest because of our interconnectedness with
the situations of others.<p>
*	Need for concrete resources - people, paper, and experience.<p>
*	We continue to believe the experience people from elsewhere visiting, living
in our communities and speaking of their reality helps - as well as exposure
visits  - and people's support to cooperatives is of assistance in
understanding. <p>
*	Need to move from an economy the "bottom line" to a full sense of
[omicron][iota][kappa][omicron][nu][omicron]&#181;[iota][alpha].<p>
<b>FAIR TRADE</b><p>
<b><i>What can the Anglican Church do to promote fair trade?  What can you do
in your community to purchase fairly traded products?  (i.e. the Ten Days for
Global Justice campaign for coffee).</i></b>In our communities, we can promote
fair trade, and get information from:<p>
*	Ten Days for Global Justice<p>
*	Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives<p>
*	Ecumenical Coalition for Economic Justices<p>
*	Task Force on Churches and Corporate Responsibility<p>
*	Promote the book "Coalitions for Justice", by Christopher Lind available from
ABC<p>
*	Join a Ten Days group<p>
*	Talk to your PWRDF Parish representative<p>
*	Get in  touch with national Eco-Justice Committee<p>
*	The Church "what can we do"?<p>
*	Encourage education on issues such as 'fair trade'<p>
*	Provide opportunities to take on leadership<p>
*	Promote awareness of issues and resources<p>
*	Watch 'Common Grounds '  video, available from Anglican Resource Centre<p>
<b>Scriptural Basis for Ethical Decision-making (From <i>Anglican Identity
Forum)</i></b><p>
.	Some ethical questions highlight the tension between the secular and sacred
and this tension causes us to reflect on our understanding of <p>
*	human nature<p>
*	values and norms implicit in our thinking.<p>
.	Scripture (the story) can assist us as we seek to proclaim new life in Christ
and seek to follow Jesus as faithful disciples.<p>
.	Take time to listen<p>
*	to each other<p>
*	to the spirit<p>
<b>Sexuality (From <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>
.	Human Sexuality is a gift from God to be reaffirmed. We do so especially in
light of the fact that many experience guilt, vulnerability, and power
imbalance in their attitudes and experiences of living out their sexuality.<p>
.	Sexuality is a gift -- it cannot be imposed as a discipline.<p>
.	Scripture, tradition and reason need to be in dialogue promoting constant
reformation -- especially promoting covenant relationships which foster the
growth of both / all participants.<p>
.	Where we begin scripturally (vis a vis sexuality)<p>
*	Informs what we think and believe about sexual expression<p>
.	Determining a reliance on scripture, tradition, and reason is a big
struggle.<p>
.	Relationships need to be an experience of wholeness and completeness and sign
of God's love!<p>
.	Reported about Diocesan issues regarding sexuality<p>
.	Pastoral underground / public<p>
Scripture / Experience<p>
.	Dialogue<p>
*	sharing ideas<p>
*	coming together<p>
*	places to talk (Youthfest, fidelity, integrity, days of dialogue)<p>
	<p>
.	Unity - move together<p>
<b>Biotechnology (From <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>
.	Ask Anglican Communion to push for UN regulation / management.<p>
.	Push for research of but limit patents for environmentally extracted
substances.<p>
.	Stewardship of the microcosm as well as the macrocosm.<p>
<b>Ecumenical Justice Coalitions (from <i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- when a coalition becomes involved in an issue that is "hot", the Church
should be informed<p>
- accountability:  how is coalition accountable to its member churches - who
decides when a coalition engages in an issue, when  does it withdraw?<p>
- accessibility: good web site on work coalitions cross-referenced by
<u>topic</u> not by name of coalition only<p>
- good information avoids duplication of effort at other levels
