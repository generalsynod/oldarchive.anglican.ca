<b>MEMO TO:	Partners in Mission Committee</b><p>
<b>FROM:		Jim Boyles</b><p>
<b>RE:			Comments from Forums at General Synod</b><p>
<b>____________________________________________________</b><p>
The following comments were recorded on newsprint and relate to the work of
your committee:<p>
<b>VOLUNTEERS IN MISSION</b><p>
<b><i>What benefits do you see to receiving missionaries to Canada?  How might
this work in your diocese/parish? </i></b><p>
*	Mutual responsibility regarding support to people  in the mission field <p>
*	Maintain personal contact with those who we have sent or gone overseas, so
that they feel connected to their home churches<p>
*	Invite a missionary to come and spend a year in various parishes <p>
*	Active sharing of our stories, akin to salesmanship.  Enthusiastically
sharing the ministry<p>
*	Sharing stories of prayerful support<p>
*	Personally or on a parish basis, reaching out to actively support refugees,
so that mission takes on a personal face<p>
*	Have inter-diocesan Companion Parishes<p>
*	Christ, make me transparent so that you may be apparent<p>
*	Tap into resources that are already in existence: military missionary
experience in regard to chaplaincy<p>
<b>UPROOTED PEOPLES</b><p>
<b><i>In what ways do you think we can be a part of the solution so that people
are not forced to leave their homes, be it to look for jobs or to search for
refuge?</i></b><p>
*	By recognizing the difference between civic and Christian responsibility
(politician) vs. (Christian political understanding)<p>
*	By assisting, supporting fair trade, understanding the injustice of the Nike
runners example and may others and that we prolong, as consumers, the problem<p>
*	By educating congregations to the problems at home and overseas, making the
connections, the parallels, recognizing food banks as good short-term efforts
but needing analysis as to why in Canada are people hungry<p>
*	By walking with, as pilgrims people on our doorstep, recognizing the health
and financial risks and fear felt mutually e.g.: working with street people<p>
*	By working ecumenically and lifting our prophetic voice<p>
	<p>
<b>YOUTH</b><p>
<b><i>In what ways do you think that youth could be enabled to experience
international partnerships of the Anglican Church of Canada?</i></b><p>
*	2001 Youth Event<p>
*	Info on the world wide web<p>
*	Need more advertising/information about national partnership/exchanges/
programs (i.e. Canada World Youth)<p>
*	National Youth Resource Network to share 'how to" info needs to be fast,
accurate and more.  Does it fall to Information Resources to do this?<p>
*	We need to learn from other countries/ denominations about how to fund this
work<p>
*	Where are the funds going to come from?<p>
*	PWRDF is looking at the future of youth involvement in the international
working being done<p>
*	Still need more National support<p>
*	We need to make this happen<p>
<b>FAIR TRADE</b><p>
<b><i>What can the Anglican Church do to promote fair trade?  What can you do
in your community to purchase fairly traded products?  (i.e. the Ten Days for
Global Justice campaign for coffee).</i></b>In our communities, we can promote
fair trade, and get information from:<p>
*	Ten Days for Global Justice<p>
*	Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives<p>
*	Ecumenical Coalition for Economic Justices<p>
*	Task Force on Churches and Corporate Responsibility<p>
*	Promote the book "Coalitions for Justice", by Christopher Lind available from
ABC<p>
*	Join a Ten Days group<p>
*	Talk to your PWRDF Parish representative<p>
*	Get in  touch with national Eco-Justice Committee<p>
*	The Church "what can we do"?<p>
*	Encourage education on issues such as 'fair trade'<p>
*	Provide opportunities to take on leadership<p>
*	Promote awareness of issues and resources<p>
*	Watch 'Common Grounds '  video, available from Anglican Resource Centre<p>
<b>MULTICULTURALISM</b><p>
<b><i>What steps do you think could be pursued to engage multicultural
communities in the life of the church and in the international
partnerships</i></b><p>
*	Old multicultural images and stereotypes are not the same todayPeople of a
same culture may reflect a wide range of cultures1st generation immigrants are
very culturally different from succeeding onesLanguage is not the only criteria
of culture<p>
*	Where are the walls of partition coming down?<p>
*	Identifying them is a big first step<p>
<b>FOREIGN AID</b><p>
<b><i>What do you think about Canada's current level of foreign
assistance.</i></b><p>
<b><i>What role might international partnerships play in informing people about
levels of international partnerships play in informing people about levels of
international development assistance.</i></b><p>
*	Ashamed and outraged at current level of foreign aid agreed amount .7% of
GNP.  Actual is less than .25%<p>
*	Need more videos like "Garbage kids" and those more widely distributed to
raise awareness<p>
*	Unmask the myth of poverty at home and our complacency for foreign aid.<p>
*	Need success stories that are viable to market to raise awareness and also
refute current perceptions of mismanagement of foreign aid.<p>
*	Churches should raise people's vision - then motivate to reach the vision<p>
*	Next year is critical to motivate government to increase commitment to
foreign aid<p>
*	Need an ecumenical collective strategy to reach  .7%  <p>
<b>PARTNERSHIP: SHARING GIFTS</b><p>
<b><i>What does this mean in practical terms in our parish or
diocese?</i></b><p>
<b><i>What gifts might we give to overseas partners?</i></b><p>
<b><i>What gifts might we receive from them?</i></b><p>
<b><i>What does our biblical understanding of stewardship teach us about the
sharing of resources?</i></b><p>
*	The meeting and connections made between 1st Nations people and partners from
the Philippines discovering similarities over land use and lack of
accountability.<p>
*	Parishes have difficulty understanding sharing gifts if parishioners do not
understand they are a part of a diocese , a national church a world.<p>
*	Volunteers In Mission, who return are `money in the bank'<p>
*	The first need in going to a new country - family, support, people to stand
with you as a partner.  We cannot stand alone.  We know this in Myanamar.  You
in Canada, you think you  can go it alone.  You give the impression you don't
need others<p>
*	Do we need help from our partners to learn how to support each other in the
face of despair and `bad news' `powerlessness'<p>
<b>COMPANION DIOCESE</b><p>
<b><i>How effective has this been in your diocese, and what could be done to
deepen the connections</i>?</b><p>
*	Companionship - go, listen, share.<p>
*	Need to buy into the process<p>
*	What if our parish writes and they don't reply<p>
*	Communication problems - language, literacy, infrastructure<p>
*	Need people exchanges at all levels, not just bishops<p>
*	Strong diocesan committee is helpful<p>
*	Cultural differences need to be worked on<p>
*	Regular prayer is valuable<p>
*	Need personal exchange<p>
*	Both partners need an awareness that each has something to give and receive<p>
	<p>
<b>JUBILEE</b><p>
<b><i>To what extent and in what ways do you think the priorities for the work
of the Partners in Mission Committee and the PWRDF Committee do or should
reflect the themes of Jubilee?</i></b><p>
*	Need a good theological reflection on the meaning of Jubilee - bible study
material<p>
*	Practical ways to practice Jubilee - 1st question, `what do we let go of?'<p>
*	Importance of Sabbath renewed<p>
*	Maintain arm lengths with government agencies<p>
*	How would debt forgiveness work at all levels?<p>
*	Balance of debt forgiveness and human rights<p>
*	Means of accountability with debt forgiveness<p>
*	Tie debt forgiveness to restorative justice<p>
*	Willing to find ways to take a prophetic voice locally in specific ways <p>
*	Dioceses finding ways of `letting go'<p>
*	Jubilee service to heal brokenness, starting with ourselves and process<p>
*	Recognition of forgiveness<p>
*	Being in partnership with those in debt / in prison<p>
<b>Jubilee (from <i>Streams of Living Justice Forum)</i></b><p>
.	The church needs to announce Jubilee as Jesus did as a celebration.  We need
to present HOPE to parishioners.<p>
.	We <u>are</u> the church - what can we do?<p>
.	When Jesus proclaimed Jubilee he was more concerned about our salvation out
of which Justice will come.  Is the church in danger of standing outside and
being the ombudsman?<p>
.	The church could/should make expectations and be prophetic in our
relationships and demands of national and international financial
organizations.<p>
.	The members of the church need to understand the full implication of Jubilee
for themselves and need to help each other to achieve the Jubilee by changing
lifestyles and assisting others internationally, nationally and corporately to
change their ways. (Resources, education, goals and objectives, prayer).<p>
<b>Jubilee (from<i> Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- Sabbath begins with hearing what each of means by Sabbath<p>
- Let us not confuse commercial celebration of millennium with Jubilee<p>
- set aside time of Sabbath each day for the next 3 years (2001)<p>
- do the givers understand the concept of - land, freedom, slavery, celebrating
Sabbath<p>
- We need to work with other ecumenical/inter-faith groups around the
categories in 4<p>
<b>Canadian Council of Churches (from <i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- yes we do need CCC<p>
- the council should be more shelf-promoting - let people know what it does<p>
- be more vocal in expressing the social conscious of members<p>
- be more pro-active of current events<p>
- use church papers (i.e. Journal) to put its ideas and policies to the
congregations and individuals<p>
- should build stronger ties with the EFC<p>
<b>Evangelical Fellowship of Canada (from <i>Ecumenical Relations
Forum)</i></b><p>
- opening a dialogue with EFC would help us understand our own internal
struggles<p>
- encourage the CCC to enter into dialogue with the EFC<p>
- consider inviting the EFC to send a partner to our next GS<p>
<b>World Council of Churches (from <i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- speak from Christian witness more specifically on new global issues of
microcosm technologies - e.g., genetic engineering, new reproductive
technologies, biotechnologies<p>
- speak with a common voice on the issues of religious persecution of
Christian<p>
- continue the work of dialogue over fundamental doctrinal matters, esp.
concerning Christian understandings of the creeds, scripture and the church.<p>
<b>Ecumenical Decade of the Churches in Solidarity with Women (from
<i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- Decade activities:<p>
	Ontario Anglican Conference <p>
	Parish in diocese of Niagara<p>
	Vancouver pre-decade activities<p>
	various - urban/rural/northern - different priorities and cultural
expectations<p>
- Future of ACW? - discussions, surveys<p>
	- importance differs in different parts of country<p>
	- leadership = challenge<p>
	- no longer just want to be those who raise $$ - want more spiritual mandate<p>
- Decade - had limited impact in most areas<p>
	- a few went to Brazil<p>
	- much greater acceptance of women for ordination - celebration of 20th -
Anniversary - and lay women in liturgical roles<p>
	- more awareness of inclusive language<p>
	- 2 female bishops<p>
	- rev. common  lectionary - more stories of women<p>
- No one could remember aims of the decade<p>
- Connections not made with ACW - MU (very powerful MU in many countries)<p>
- Anglicans in many 3rd World Countries not asking theses questions - - -
yet.<p>
- Decade has allowed more choices - both women/men<p>
- Who<u> was</u> responsible for the decade anyway?<p>
- How was information disseminated?  Often get stuck<p>
- Happened at same time both CCC &amp; ACC cutting staff<p>
- Great things have happened anyway<p>
- Nowhere to go but up - ACC take responsibility for some of these issues -
need emphasis on societal issues re women:  violence, abuse, child care, elder
care, health care<p>
<b>Ecumenical Justice Coalitions (from <i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- when a coalition becomes involved in an issue that is "hot", the Church
should be informed<p>
- accountability:  how is coalition accountable to its member churches - who
decides when a coalition engages in an issue, when  does it withdraw?<p>
- accessibility: good web site on work coalitions cross-referenced by
<u>topic</u> not by name of coalition only<p>
- good information avoids duplication of effort at other levels<p>
<b>Inculturation (from <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>

*	welcoming people<p>
*	redefine mission<p>
*	self determination<p>
*	not everything works for everyone<p>
<b>Scripture and Culture (from <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>
1.	The Gospel of Christ speaks to us through the cultures of the Bible. <p>
2.	How do we engage the particularity of the Biblical witness as we seek to
address to the cultural realities of our day? How does our culture provide
lenses through which we read the bible? And how might the bible provide lenses
through which we might see our culture anew?<p>
3.	We are all shaped by traditions whether we accept it or not.<p>
<b>Towards Sustainable Community (from <i>Streams of Living Justice
Forum)</i></b><p>
.	We must understand exactly what sustainable community is on a local level.<p>
.	Our local communities are out of balance in many ways:<br>- depletion of
natural resources<br>- unemployment (and consequently migration)<br>- lack of
togetherness on a community level e.g. helping each other.<p>
.	The church needs to promote its <u>vision</u> on community and the care of
the earth - what is the "good life"<p>
.	Partnership with local churches and other national churches.<p>
.	Biblical/spiritual foundation for community action.<p>
.	Developing partnerships with governments.  Example: working guaranteed annual
income.<p>
.	Pairing North/South churches.<p>
.	Compassion for refugees and economic migrants.
