<b>The Church in the North and Aboriginal Peoples (from<i> Northern Lights
Forum)</i></b><p>
<i>The Council of the North dioceses have given special attention to our
relationship with the Anglican Council of Indigenous People during the last
triennium.</i><p>
<i>	a) What further steps can be taken to enrich our partnership with
aboriginal 	  	    people, especially as we move in the direction of the
Covenant and in other 	 	    areas of mutual ministry?</i><p>
<i>	b) How can the Canadian Council respond to the challenge of the Anglican
	    Council of Indigenous People and the Council of the North to the spiritual

cities?</i><p>

<b>JUBILEE</b><p>
<b><i>To what extent and in what ways do you think the priorities for the work

<b>Jubilee (from <i>Streams of Living Justice Forum)</i></b><p>
.	The church needs to announce Jubilee as Jesus did as a celebration.  We need
to present HOPE to parishioners.<p>
.	We <u>are</u> the church - what can we do?<p>
.	When Jesus proclaimed Jubilee he was more concerned about our salvation out
of which Justice will come.  Is the church in danger of standing outside and
being the ombudsman?<p>
.	The church could/should make expectations and be prophetic in our
relationships and demands of national and international financial
organizations.<p>
.	The members of the church need to understand the full implication of Jubilee
for themselves and need to help each other to achieve the Jubilee by changing
lifestyles and assisting others internationally, nationally and corporately to
change their ways. (Resources, education, goals and objectives, prayer).<p>
<b>Jubilee (from<i> Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- Sabbath begins with hearing what each of means by Sabbath<p>
- Let us not confuse commercial celebration of millennium with Jubilee<p>
- set aside time of Sabbath each day for the next 3 years (2001)<p>
- do the givers understand the concept of - land, freedom, slavery, celebrating
Sabbath<p>
- We need to work with other ecumenical/inter-faith groups around the
categories in 4<p>
<b>Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (From <i>Streams of Living Justice
Forum)</i></b><p>
.	Visibility - varies from highly visible to areas where there are no
indigenous people in churches.  Particularly in cities there are indigenous
people not connected to church or home communities.<p>
.	Awareness - the responsibility is personal awareness and action begins with
each of us living our lives as Christians where we are.<p>
<b>Inculturation (From <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>
.	Sharing our Story<p>
*	Different pieces of the story of who we are<p>
*	stop addressing, start listening<p>
*	"pushed into shoes that don't really fit"<p>
*	Anglicanism - grass roots religion<p>
.	Practicing as a Community<p>
*	liturgy is cultural<p>
*	welcome uniqueness<p>
*	build liturgy around the community<p>
*	more patterns of worship than text<p>
*	tradition continues to speak to people<p>
.	How do we love?<p>
*	flexibility in recognizing needs<p>
*	be user friendly<p>
*	recognize the marginalized<p>
*	welcoming people<p>
*	redefine mission<p>
*	self determination<p>
*	not everything works for everyone<p>
<b> Scripture and Culture (From <i>Anglican Identity Forum)</i></b><p>
.	The Gospel of Christ speaks to us through the cultures of the Bible. <p>
.	How do we engage the particularity of the Biblical witness as we seek to
address to the cultural realities of our day? How does our culture provide
lenses through which we read the bible? And how might the bible provide lenses
through which we might see our culture anew?<p>
.	We are all shaped by traditions whether we accept it or not.
