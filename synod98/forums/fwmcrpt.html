<b>MEMO TO:	Faith, Worship and Ministry Committee	</b><p>
<b>FROM:		Jim Boyles, General Secretary</b><p>
<b>RE:			Comments from Forums at General Synod</b><p>
<b>____________________________________________________</b><p>
The following comments were recorded on newsprint and relate to the work of
your committee:<p>
<b>1) Common Prayer in Canada</b><p>
1.	Common prayer appears to remain a central characteristic<p>
*	Wide variety of forms to meet people's needs<p>
2.	What makes it Anglican?<p>
*	participation of people<p>
*	service has "substance"<p>
*	scriptures<p>
3.	Liturgy does affect our beliefs.<p>
*	scriptures essential<p>
*	scriptures are the source of our teaching<p>
4.	Children - how do we attract them in order to give them the basics?<p>
<b>2) Common Prayer in the Communion</b><p>
1.	Our common prayer is "One in Christ" - In order to validate common prayer
the spirit of love must be present.<p>
2.	The Structure is relevant<p>
*	 even if language is not understood, if the spirit is present, common prayer
has life.<p>
3.	Structure is irrelevant - <p>
*	common prayer is "dead" without the spirit<p>
There are religious Anglicans and there are Anglican Christians.<p>
<b>3) Inculturation</b><p>
1.	Sharing our Story<p>
*	Different pieces of the story of who we are<p>
*	stop addressing, start listening<p>
*	"pushed into shoes that don't really fit"<p>
*	Anglicanism - grass roots religion<p>
2.	Practicing as a Community<p>
*	liturgy is cultural<p>
*	welcome uniqueness<p>
*	build liturgy around the community<p>
*	more patterns of worship than text<p>
*	tradition continues to speak to people<p>
3.	How do we love?<p>
*	flexibility in recognizing needs; be user friendly; recognize the
marginalized; welcoming people; redefine mission; self determination; not
everything works for everyone<p>
<b>4) Authority, Revelation and Discernment</b><p>
1.	We understand authority as servant authority<p>
2.	Authority is the property of the whole church<p>
3.	We believe that there are Christian absolutes that are defined in the
creeds<p>
4.	We must act pastorally to those who feel disenfranchised.<p>
*	How are these authorities (Scripture, Tradition, Reason) to be balanced and
weighed as the church faces contentious and divisive issues?<p>
5.	What is the basis and nature of Christian authority in Anglican Tradition
and practice<p>
6.	Why is authority important to the church and how should it be exercised to
build up the community so we can answer enquirers from a Solid basis (more than
opinion) / not from opinion.<p>
<b>5) Scripture and Culture</b><p>
1.	The Gospel of Christ speaks to us through the cultures of the Bible. <p>
2.	How do we engage the particularity of the Biblical witness as we seek to
address to the cultural realities of our day? How does our culture provide
lenses through which we read the bible? And how might the bible provide lenses
through which we might see our culture anew?<p>
3.	We are all shaped by traditions whether we accept it or not.<p>
4.	It is up to the people, through the help (discernment) of the Spirit to
apply the truth through the cultural lenses that hinder us.<p>
5.	The same lenses that hinder, can help us..<p>
<b>6) Tradition</b><p>
1.	Traditions like a candle - passed from one generation to the next. Each
generation's task is to make the light of Christ's presence shine brightest by
discerning "<u>essential wick</u>" from "<u>amendable wax</u>."<p>
<b>7) Authority of Personal Experience</b><p>
1.	We ignore experience at our peril.- it comes in whether we name it or not
and acts as filter<p>
2.	God continues to reveal God's purpose... the good news continues in our
experience.... and scripture lives anew.<p>
3.	In an organic community (vs. a collection of individuals) discernment occurs
and truth is tested and refined.<p>
4.	Personal experience needs to be tested by scripture as the ultimate
authority<p>
5.	Personal experience has to be in dialogue with scripture and the  tradition
(The teaching) of the church with reason as the media<p>
6.	Personal experienced is nurtured and sustained by the faith and experience
of the church.<p>
<b>8) Postmodernism: Blessing or Curse?</b><p>
1.	Postmodernism is the context within which Christian dialogue and discernment
must inevitable occur.<p>
2.	Postmodernity is simultaneously embraced and rejected by members of the
church. This creates both the opportunity for dialogue and conflict regarding
our identity.<p>
3.	As Christians, regardless of the "isms" to which we ascribe, we are unified
by our love of God and the love, compassion, respect, and affirmation of life
we meet in one another through Jesus Christ.<p>
<b>9) Formation for Ministry</b><p>
1.	National consultation to draw up requirements for ordained ministry to
include heads of colleges, bishops, religious communities<p>
2.	Discernment<p>
*	candidate and diocese (+ parish re: local ordained / lay ministries)<p>
*	Formation<p>
*	of the whole being, mind, body, spirit<p>
*	mentoring + spiritual guidance<p>
3.	Training<p>
*	National core<p>
*	localized based on local needs<p>
*	dialogue between church and training institutions<p>
*	National dialogue - GS perhaps house of Bishop's<p>
	<p>
<b>10) Shape of Future Ministry</b><p>
1.	Usage of local people<p>
*	team ministry where lay and ordained work together<p>
2.	Team needs outside guidance and coordination (sic) / supervision<p>
*	i.e. Paul's letters to the churches<p>
3.	Vision for lay involvement - requirement of certain standards - so that
individuals would have a foundation<p>
4.	Discernment process  - Asking parish to identify those individuals who are
qualified and accepted to take on these roles for ministry.<p>
5.	Develop ministry development coordinator.<p>
<b>11) Covenant</b><p>
1.	Role models / leaders giving hope<p>
2.	Ownership / permission helped raise awareness<p>
3.	Equality<p>
<b>12) Ecumenical Relations</b><p>
1.	Shared Theological Education:<p>
*	more intentional linking<p>
*	help affect behaviour / attitudes.<p>
2.	Community Service: (Common goals)<p>
*	coalitions<p>
*	grassroots (has to be experienced here)<p>
	<p>
3.	Covenant:<p>
*	enabling people to make agreements<p>
*	processes that help people share values and beliefs<p>
*	Using your baptismal covenant as a building block.<p>
<b>13) Scriptural Basis for Ethical Decision-making</b><p>
1.	Some ethical questions highlight the tension between the secular and sacred
and this tension causes us to reflect on our understanding of <p>
*	human nature<p>
*	values and norms implicit in our thinking.<p>
2.	Scripture (the story) can assist us as we seek to proclaim new life in
Christ and seek to follow Jesus as faithful disciples.<p>
3.	Take time to listen<p>
*	to each other<p>
*	to the spirit<p>
<b>14) Sexuality</b><p>
1.	Human Sexuality is a gift from God to be reaffirmed. We do so especially in
light of the fact that many experience guilt, vulnerability, and power
imbalance in their attitudes and experiences of living out their sexuality.<p>
2.	Sexuality is a gift -- it cannot be imposed as a discipline.<p>
3.	Scripture, tradition and reason need to be in dialogue promoting constant
reformation -- especially promoting covenant relationships which foster the
growth of both / all participants.<p>
4.	Where we begin scripturally (vis a vis sexuality)<p>
*	Informs what we think and believe about sexual expression<p>
5.	Determining a reliance on scripture, tradition, and reason is a big
struggle.<p>
6.	Relationships need to be an experience of wholeness and completeness and
sign of God's love!<p>
7.	Scripture / Experience<p>
*	Dialogue: sharing ideas; coming together; places to talk (Youthfest,
fidelity, integrity, days of dialogue)<p>
8.	Unity - move together<p>
<b>15) Euthanasia</b><p>
1.	More references / resources would be beneficial<p>
2.	Some statements need to be more specific. Examples should be given in
paragraph 4. E.g. elder abuse.<p>
3.	The role of the church (lay and ordained - pastoral care) is important in
providing support to the families of people with disabilities<p>
4.	Para 3 (idea of hospice) needs to be expanded -&gt; hope.<p>
5.	Caregiver support is essential.<p>
6.	What about issues such as living wills or advanced directives for health
care?<p>
7.	Euthanasia is a failure of palliative care<p>
8.	The Church should lobby for more funding for programs to support palliative
care<p>
9.	The Church community needs to give care and support to the living relatives
and / or other caregivers.<p>
<b>16) Biotechnology</b><p>
1.	Ask Anglican Communion to push for UN regulation / management.<p>
2.	Push for research of but limit patents for environmentally extracted
substances.<p>
3.	Stewardship of the microcosm as well as the macrocosm.<p>

<b>Jubilee (from <i>Streams of Living Justice)</i></b><p>
.	The church needs to announce Jubilee as Jesus did as a celebration.  We need
to present HOPE to parishioners.<p>
.	We <u>are</u> the church - what can we do?<p>
.	When Jesus proclaimed Jubilee he was more concerned about our salvation out
of which Justice will come.  Is the church in danger of standing outside and
being the ombudsman?<p>
.	The church could/should make expectations and be prophetic in our
relationships and demands of national and international financial
organizations.<p>
.	The members of the church need to understand the full implication of Jubilee
for themselves and need to help each other to achieve the Jubilee by changing
lifestyles and assisting others internationally, nationally and corporately to
change their ways. (Resources, education, goals and objectives, prayer).<p>

<p>
*	how do we publicize what is already happening?  We do not want to arrive at
the "altar" and back away.  <p>
*	how do we <u>energize</u> the "grassroots" to read, mark, learn and inwardly
digest?  <p>
*	<u>publicize existing resources; prepare new ones, Get the word out.</u>  <p>

<b><u>Shared Ministries (from </u><cite>Ecumenical Relations
Forum)</cite></b><p>
<u>Stumbling blocks</u><p>
- differing Eucharistic traditions - frequency<p>
				presidency<p>
				consummation of elements<p>
- diverse reporting forms<p>
- differing financial participation<p>
- conflict with sacramental theologies, e.g. confirmation, same-sex issues<p>
- lives of authority - pressure on clergy<p>
		  - non-support of judicatory bodies<p>
-moving beyond motive of expedience<p>
- too many buildings<p>
- preservation of distinct identities (also a way to overcome!<p>
<u>Overcoming blocks</u><p>
- establishing self-determined motives, e.g. outreach mission<p>
- support of judicatory bodies essential<p>
- processes that examine share values/beliefs - consultations<p>
- establish formal covenant<p>
- develop mission statement and goals<p>
- use of joint "council" of shared leadership<p>
- trained/committed leadership<p>
- conserve and shared resources <p>
<b>Other Dialogues (from <i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- We need to be aware of the "underground" ecumenism already taking place in
the church - house church etc., elicit ecumenical celebrations of the
Eucharist<p>
<b>Canadian Council of Churches (from <i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
- yes we do need CCC<p>
- the council should be more shelf-promoting - let people know what it does<p>
- be more vocal in expressing the social conscious of members<p>
- be more pro-active of current events<p>
- use church papers (i.e. Journal) to put its ideas and policies to the
congregations and individuals<p>
- should build stronger ties with the EFC<p>
<b>Ecumenical Decade of the Churches in Solidarity with Women (from
<i>Ecumenical Relations Forum)</i></b><p>
Decade Activities:<p>
*	Ontario Anglican Conference<p>
*	Parish in diocese of Niagara<p>
*	Vancouver pre-decade activities<p>
*	various - urban/rural/northern - different priorities and cultural
expectations<p>
Future of ACW? - discussions, surveys<p>
*	importance differs in different parts of country<p>
*	leadership = challenge<p>
*	non longer just want to be those who raise $$ - want more spiritual mandate<p>
Decade - had limited impact in most areas<p>
	- a few went to Brazil<p>
	- much greater acceptance of women for ordination - celebration of 20th
anniversary - and lay women in liturgical roles<p>
	- more awareness of inclusive language<p>
	- 2 female bishops<p>
	- rev. common  lectionary - more stories of women<p>
- No one could remember aims of the decade<p>
- Connections not made with ACW - MU (very powerful MU in many countries)<p>
- Anglicans in many 3rd World Countries not asking theses questions - - -
yet.<p>
- Decade has allowed more choices - both women/men<p>
- Who<u> was</u> responsible for the decade anyway?<p>
- How was information disseminated?  Often get stuck<p>
- Happened at same time both CCC &amp; ACC cutting staff<p>
- Great things have happened anyway<p>
- Nowhere to go but up - ACC take responsibility for some of these issues -
need 	emphasis on societal issues re women:  violence, abuse, child care, elder
care, 	health care
