<b>Anglican Journal Editorial Balance</b><p>
*	an "Anglican" house organ; open to criticism but dedicated to strengthening
the church<p>
*	should be reporting news, not making it<p>
*	a need for balance between editorial independence and the need to notify the
church of the work of the church<p>

needs to be something that can build the church<p>
<b>Called to Full Communion with Lutherans</b><p>

(sermons, newsletters, guest speakers, etc.)<p>
*	How do we publicize the processand provide effective information resources?<p>
*	How do we publicize what is already happening?<p>
*	study guide use among Ang/ELCIC congretagions to be encouraged - disseminate
publications to each other (diocesan papers, advertize in each, summer camps)<p>
*	joint pastoral letters and statements<p>
<b>Canadian Council of Churches</b><p>
*	use church papers (i.e the Journal) to put its ideas and policies to the
congregations and individuals
