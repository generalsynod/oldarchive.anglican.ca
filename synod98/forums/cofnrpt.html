<b>MEMO TO:	Council of the North</b><p>
<b>FROM:		Jim Boyles, General Secretary</b><p>
<b>RE:			Comments from Forums at General Synod</b><p>
<b>____________________________________________________</b><p>
The following comments were recorded on newsprint and relate to the work of the
Council of the North:<p>
<b>The Church in the North and the Church in the South</b><p>
<i>In what ways does the concept of "mutual responsibility and interdependence
in the body of Christ" apply to the Anglican church of Canada's ministry in the
North?</i><p>
<i>	a) What contribution can Anglicans in the North make to the wider
church?</i><p>
<i>	b) What ways can the Canadian Church continue to support our ministry in
the 	 	    North?</i><p>
*	We need to share our lives together across North South boundaries ( which
have served to isolate us) so that we may truly be one body.<p>
	share stories<p>
	Canadian Church partnerships<p>
	face failings<p>
	re-focus on Gospel<p>
*	Explore and learn from the way mission is done in the North and their
understanding of community<p>
*	Willingness to participate in each others culture through interaction.<p>
*	"I am  a member of all 30 dioceses." National prayer Cycle (Monthly and
Sunday independent)<p>
*	Re-thinking Partnerships South and north dioceses and parishes.  Putting a
Human Face.<p>
*	Ministry to one another over:<p>
	Finances<p>
*	The North can teach the South about transparency in relationships (e.g.
common standards in stipends and reporting).<p>
<b>The Church in the North and Aboriginal Peoples</b><p>
<i>The Council of the North dioceses have given special attention to our
relationship with the Anglican Council of Indigenous People during the last
triennium.</i><p>
<i>	a) What further steps can be taken to enrich our partnership with
aboriginal 	  	    people, especially as we move in the direction of the
Covenant and in other 	 	    areas of mutual ministry?</i><p>
<i>	b) How can the Canadian Council respond to the challenge of the Anglican
	    Council of Indigenous People and the Council of the North to the spiritual
and 	 	    other needs of Aboriginal peoples living in large southern Canadian
cities?</i><p>
*	A healthy Church requires a healthy community.<p>
*	Development of Companion Congregations.<p>
*	How can the Church facilitate urban native people connect with their own
culture and language?<p>
	<p>
<p>
<p>
Find Diocesan models that work e.g. Diocese of Brandon model.<p>
<b>*	</b>Learn from one another through parish<p>
<b>The Church in the  North and New Models of Ministry</b><p>
<i>For a variety of reasons, Northern ministry has had to examine new models of
ministry, indigenization, and expressing the Gospel in different
cultures.</i><p>
<i>	a) Is there learning for the whole Canadian Church from these new
expressions of 	 	   ministry?</i><p>
<i>	b) Are there other understandings of ministry we could learn from Northern
	    partners?</i><p>
*	There are many ways to make decisions by combining both ideas in
partnership.<p>
*	Southern Churches can learn -participation<p>
                                            	    -acceptance<p>
                                                  -sharing<p>
                                                   -companionship<p>
<center>All in the unity of Brothers and Sisters in Christ.</center><p>
*	Leaders in any community must be recognized, called, supported and welcomed
to serve in their<u> own</u> community;<p>
*	Circles work best for sharing building trust, listening to one another.  One
person speaks until they have finished speaking;<p>
*	Circles are for healing, for resolving conflict, for deciding on punishments,
for giving;<p>
*	Consensus is better than voting;<p>
*	Non-stipendiary ministry is growing --people can be bi-vocational;<p>
*	We need to affirm gifts and share stories;<p>
*	We in the cities have much to learn from our Northern partners. <p>
*	Yes!  The financial crises have opened the way for the Holy Spirit to raise
up many and varied lay ministries.<p>
*	We are not as different as we might think.<p>
<b>We Recommend</b><p>
1.  When a new clergy person comes to a parish that a covenant be used wherein
the people undertake to do specific ministry and the priest also commits to
provide specific ministry.<p>
2.  The Team Ministry approach where a trained leader oversees other team
members who bring their own gifts to the ministry.  One does pastoral care,
youth work, administration, etc.<p>
<b>We are Concerned</b><p>
That the use of "part time" clergy is not a permanent solution for provision of
ministry. <p>
<b>The Church in the North and Self-Sufficiency</b><p>
<i>One of the goals of our strategic plan for our National Church is to
strengthen commitment of the whole church to domestic mission in partnership
with the Council of the North and to work with the Council to move towards
self-sufficiency.</i><p>
<i>	a) What steps are being taken in the Council of the Northern dioceses to
realize 	 	    this goal?</i><p>
<i>	b) What further steps can be taken to encourage increased stewardship
education 	 	    in Northern dioceses?</i><p>
<i>	c) What is the relationship between being a missionary church and financial
 	    responsibility?</i><p>
i. Reduction of funding to all Council Dioceses by 21%.<p>
ii In some dioceses vigorous stewardship education has proven effective.<p>
iii. Non stipendiaries<p>
Conversion to the Church is important ;<p>
	Increased sense of ownership.<p>
	willingness to explore alternative models of ministry.
