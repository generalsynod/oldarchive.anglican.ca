die to win<p>
<b>Three Year Planning</b><p>
*	Steps to get there<p>
*	definitely possible  - goal much more than survival - vision absolutely
necessary - money planning as part of our ministry<p>
*	pray<p>
*	communicate the vision - on-going<p>
*	active participation<p>

*	anticipate as much as possible with flexibility, on-going communication,
education accountability - goals re-evaluate<p>
*	build on strengths of evangelism, stewardship<p>
*	positive attitude - pro-active learning opportunities<p>
<b>The Church in the North and the Church in the South</b><p>
*	Ministry to one another over: finances<p>
*	The North can teach the South about transparency in relationships (e.g.
common standards in stipends and reporting).<p>
<b>The Church in the North and Self-Sufficiency</b><p>
*	Reduction of funding to all Council Dioceses by 21%<p>
*	In some dioceses vigorous stewardship education has proven effective<p>
*	Non-stipendiaries<p>
*	Conversion to the Church is important:<p>
Increased sense of ownership<p>
willingness to explore alternative models of ministry<p>
<b>Making Moral Economic Decisions</b><p>
*	Moral economic decisions begin with personal commitment to the personal
decisions we can control.<p>
*	Equip church people to be a moral conscience in their workplace<p>
<b>Jubilee - A Celebration of Hope</b><p>
<b>*	</b>The Church could/should make expectations and be prophetic in our
relationships and demands of national and international financial
organizations.<p>
<b>Debt Cancellation</b><p>
*	We agree with the campaign but believe it will be a "hard go" and "hard sell"
in one parishes and in the context of our society because of attitudes, fear,
and enormity of the issues and amounts of $, understanding of the other's
reality, locus of power.<p>
	<p>
*	Forgiveness is an act of self interest because of our interconnectedness with
the situations of others.<p>
	<p>
*	Need for concrete resources - people, paper, and experience.<p>
	<p>
*	We continue to believe the experience people from elsewhere visiting, living
in our communities and speaking of their reality helps - as well as exposure
visits  - and people's support to cooperatives is of assistance in
understanding. <p>
	<p>
*	Need to move from an economy the "bottom line" to a full sense of
[omicron][iota][kappa][omicron][nu][omicron]&#181;[iota][alpha].<p>
	<p>
*	Need a good theological reflection on the meaning of Jubilee - bible study
material<p>
