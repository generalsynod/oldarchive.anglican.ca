    Synod Times</em> - March 1998</big><br>
    </font></strong><small><font face="Arial">The cyber hills are now alive with the sound of
    General Synod! The World Wide Web has become a source of finding out what&#146;s happening
    at GS. As well, there are several ways that people from around the cyber world can talk to
    each other about General Synod. A GS web site can be found at: <a
    href="https://www.anglican.ca/synod98/">https://www.anglican.ca/synod98/</a></font></small><p><small><font
    face="Arial">Visitors will find up to date information about GS planning, the issues and
    agenda items, news releases, online versions of the GST and much more.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">During GS, the web site will take you right to the plenary
    floor and provide up to the moment descriptions of what is happening. <a
    href="mailto:tmaffin@direct.ca">Tod Maffin</a>, of the <a
    href="https://www.vancouver.anglican.ca">Diocese of New Westminster</a>, will be covering
    all of the action and reporting online.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial">If you want to know what&#146;s happening in the Diocese of
    Montreal, visit https://www.montreal.anglican.org/gensynod/
    Web Master Alan Perry, will keep you current on local arrangements and news from the
    Diocese and City of Montreal. (Check out live images of Montreal from the MontrealCam!)</font></small></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>If you&#146;re chomping at the bit to start talking about GS
    (and related matters) right now, you can join the General Synod Mail list. Simply send an
    e-mail message to: no longer used.
    with no subject and the following text: <em>subscribe acc-synod98</em>.&nbsp; Another way
    to join the action is to visit the GS web site, go to the Stay
    Updated page and follow the sign-up directions. Membership on the GS mail list is open

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">Sessional Committees</font></font><font face="Arial"
    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>The General Synod Handbook calls for the
    creation of several committees to help facilitate various pieces of work at General Synod.
    Here&#146;s a brief description (and the name of the Chair) of some of those committees.
    The Chairs are all very approachable if you have a question or comment about their
    committee&#146;s work.<br>
    The Agenda Committee (Canon Allen Box) has the responsibility to prepare and publish the
    agenda for each day of the session. The Nominating Committee (Archdeacon Rodney Andrews)
    receives nominations for standing committees and the Council of General Synod (COGS). The
    committee also supervises the election process. The Resolutions Committee (Archbishop
    David Crawley) receives resolutions from members of GS and prepares them for submission in
    accordance with guidelines approved by COGS. The Credentials Committee (Chancellor David
    Wright) reports to the General Synod on the standing of all persons who claim membership
    therein, and advises the chairperson as to a quorum of each Order. The Expenditures
    Committee (Mr. Robert Dickson) has responsibility to implement Rule of Order 15 with
    respect to spending motions for which sources of funds have not been identified prior to
    the General Synod session. The Worship Committee (Mrs. Elizabeth Hutchinson) is
    responsible for daily worship, the Opening Eucharist, etc.<br>

    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>A Children&#146;s Program will take place on
    Saturday May 23. Participants will include children from Montreal and neighbouring
    dioceses. One of the highlights of the program will be an Intergenerational Worship
    Service with Members of General Synod.<br>
    <br>
    </small><big><strong><font color="#800080">Forum Update</font></strong></big><small><br>
    In April all Members of General Synod will receive a list of issues that will form the
    topics for table group discussions. Diocesan delegations should consult among themselves
    to identify the issues that are of greatest priority to them, so that they can decide
    where to send their participants.<br>
    A great deal of work in now underway by the lead committees to develop creative
    presentations to introduce the themes for each FORUM. <br>

    A special edition of </font></small><font face="Times New Roman"><em>Ministry</em>Matters </font><font
    face="Arial"><small>called Faces &amp; Ministries will soon be arriving in mail boxes
    across the country. It is a very helpful resource that &#147;explains the work of the
    General Synod staff and attempts to put faces to those tasks.&#148; It provides very
    useful background information for anyone coming to General Synod.<br>

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">Nation and Identity</font></font><font face="Arial"
    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>On Tuesday May 25, General Synod will be offered
    a unique opportunity to consider the pressing issues facing our nation. Voices will be
    lifted from different regions of Canada covering a variety of perspectives. The session is
    being designed to facilitate a genuine exchange of information. Guest panelists will
    include: the Honourable Claude Ryan, Archdeacon Rod Gillis and Mr. Brian Smith. Other
    panelists are being recruited at this time.<br>

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">What Should I Wear?</font></font><font face="Arial"
    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>For the most part, the sessions of GS are quite
    casual. The times for &#147;Sunday Best&#148; are: The Opening Eucharist (May 21), the
    Host Diocese Banquet (May 23) and the Parish Visits (May 24). One of the most important
    items to pack will be comfortable walking shoes. The average temperature in Montreal
    during the month of May is 19?C/66?F.<br>

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">Airport Tax</font></font><font face="Arial"
    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>Attention Air Travellers: Don&#146;t forget that
    at the time of your departure, you will be required to submit to the airport authorities a
    $10 departure tax. <br>

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">Jubilee</font></font><font face="Arial"
    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>This GS will be the last of the second
    millenium. As we approach the new millenium, work is being done by several standing
    committees to coordinate plans and develop resources that will enable Anglicans,
    individually and with their neighbours, to become engaged in a process of refreshment,
    reflection, prayer, renewal and action in a year of Jubilee.<br>
    At its most recent meeting, the Council of General Synod approved a request to the General
    Synod Planning Committee to make provision on the GS agenda for a Launch of the Jubilee
    Initiative.<br>

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">Profile....</font></font><font face="Arial"
    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>Jamie Tomlinson is the Coordinator for General
    Synod 1998. &#147;Don&#146;t tell the General Secretary or my wife, but I&#146;d do this
    job for free!&#148;says Jamie. Jamie is no stranger to General Synods or event planning.
    He was a member of the 1992 and 1995 Synods, and helped plan the &#145;95 GS as a member
    of the Organization Committee, Local Arrangements Committee and Worship Committee. He was
    a member of the Information Resources Committee during the last triennium before beginning
    his GS work. His primary focus is the safety, security and comfort of every person coming
    to Synod.<br>
    <br>
    Jamie lives in Ottawa with his wife, Pat and four year old son, Simon; he enjoys frequent
    trips to Montreal and Toronto and all the diverse work involved in planning for General
    Synod. If you have a question about GS, ask Jamie...he may not have the answer but he will
    help you get one.<br>
