</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>The Countdown Continues</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Welcome to the second issue of the <I>General Synod Times</I>. Do you realize that as of October 1 there were <B>only 232 days until the start of General Synod!</B> In this issue we will shed some more light on the GS agenda, update you on planning and whet your appetite with more tasty morsels about our host site.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Agenda Updates</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The General Synod Planning Committee reports that the nine days of General Synod will be filled with a fine blend of storytelling, worship, debate, presentations, and experiencing a flavour of the Diocese of Montreal.</P>
<P>The agenda will be highlighted with a series of forums (some say fora.) Each forum will provide an opportunity for General Synod members to engage in dialogue and discussion around the important issues facing the church. They will be structured to cover the seven goal areas of the strategic plan. Each forum will be organized under a goal area, but are not meant to be surveys of all activities under that area.</P>

<P>At this time the GSPC is planning topics for fora as follows:</P>
<P>FORUM I  Topics: 1. Partnerships</P>
<P>2. The North</P>
<P>FORUM II  Topics: 1. Anglican Identity</P>
<P> 2. Services to Dioceses</P>
<P>FORUM III  Topics: 1. Ecumenical Relationships</P>
<P>2. Social Justice</P>
<P>FORUM IV Topic: Diocesan Response to the Strategic Plan</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Host Diocese Banquet</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The Diocese of Montreal will host a banquet for members of General Synod on Saturday May 23. The evening will feature fine food and fabulous entertainment. Brian Hammond, Chair of the Local Arrangements Committee, says that the venue for the banquet will provide members with &quot;a feast for all five of the senses. The banquet will be held at a venue that offers a spectacular sample of the city of Montreal!&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>GS Broadcasts</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The story of General Synod will be spread to a nation wide audience! Half-hour long broadcasts highlighting the proceedings of General Synod, the mission of the Anglican Church of Canada and the ministry of the host diocese will air on <I>Canada’s faith network</I> Vision TV.</P>
<P>The broadcasts will be aired, during prime time, from Monday May 25 to Friday May 29. An information campaign promoting the broadcasts will be launched next Spring. Doug Tindal, Director of Information Resources, says &quot;the Vision TV broadcasts are an excellent way to reach not only Canadian Anglicans but others in communities across the country.&quot;</P>
<P>Lisa Barry, Senior Producer, for Anglican Video, reports that production work has already begun for the broadcasts, in Montreal and other parts of the country.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>GS Worship Notes</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The General Synod Worship Committee has come up with a unique way to begin the Opening Eucharist, to take place Thursday May 21. General Synod members will process into Christ Church Cathedral in their diocesan delegations.</P>
<P>The Primate, Archbishop Michael Peers, will be the Celebrant at the Eucharist. Bishop French Chang-Him, Bishop of the Seychelles, will preach.</P>
<P>We are fortunate to have Patrick Wedd, of the Diocese of Montreal, as the GS Music Coordinator. The music that will be sung during General Synod will feature selections from the new hymn book: <I>Common Praise.</I> Patrick invites members to consider joining the &quot;impromptu&quot; General Synod choir to help lift every voice in song.</P>
<P>Each morning at Synod we will begin our days with Morning Prayer and Bible Reflection. These sessions will take place in the plenary hall.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Montreal....Facts &amp; Figures</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Distance to McGill University from the Dorval Airport: 20 km (12 miles). Distance to McGill University from the Montreal Train Station: 3km. Walking time from McGill to Christ Church Cathedral: 14 minutes (that’s going downhill, the walk back up feels much longer!)</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Convening Circular</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The Convening Circular provides important background for General Synod members as they prepare for Synod. It also represents the historic record of the work of the national church over the last triennium. National Standing Committees, Councils and Commissions will include in their reports: an overview of the committee’s work, an accounting of actions taken in response to 1995 General Synod Resolutions, a listing of ongoing and future work commended to the successor committee. General Synod members can expect to receive their copy of the Convening Circular next April.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>GS Summary Video</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The GSPC has proposed that a 30-minute video be produced and presented to General Synod in the early part of the meeting. It will attempt to summarize the work of the past triennium and report on how we have functioned under the guidance of the strategic plan. Anglican Video has agreed to produce this video and will be working with a staff group and the Mission Coordination Group to develop its style and content.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Profile....</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Lisa Barry is the Senior Producer for Anglican Video. Montreal ‘98 will be Lisa’s fourth General Synod. Her tasks at GS include providing technical management of &quot;the floor.&quot; Lisa ensures that all audio and video resources in the plenary operate smoothly and efficiently. Lisa is also responsible for getting the daily program ready for broadcast. That involves hours of editing raw footage while keeping an eye on debate so that the program accurately reflects the tone and tenor of what is happening at General Synod. One of Lisa’s many gifts is the ability to do her GS work on about 3 to 4 hours of sleep!</P>
