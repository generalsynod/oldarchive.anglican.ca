    Synod Times</em> - May 1998</big><br>
    It's Time!<br>
    </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2">As of May 1 there were just 20 sleeps until
    the start of General Synod 1998.We&#146;ve made our preparation list and checked it twice.
    Montreal, McGill University and General Synod are ready for your arrival and the start of
    the last General Synod of this century!</font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Forums<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">In their most recent mailing, GS members
    received a booklet of information describing the content of the FORUM sessions. Included
    was a Response Sheet on which members are to record their preference of the sessions at
    which they will participate. Please remember to have the tear-off portion of the sheet
    ready to deposit when you register at General Synod.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its April meeting, the General Synod Planning Committee
    considered who should participate in FORUM sessions: &quot;Members of General Synod,
    Ecumenical and Overseas Partners and members of Committee and Councils related to General
    Synod.&quot;</font></p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Agenda Notes<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial"><b>Wednesday, May 20</b> * Set-up will
    be taking place in the plenary hall. * Member Registration will be open (in McConnell
    Residence) from noon until 9:00 p.m.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Thursday, May 21</b> * Sessional Committees meet throughout the
    day. * Orientation, coordinated by Dean James Merrett on behalf of the GS Planning
    Committee, takes place from 2:00 p.m. until 3:30 p.m. in the Bishop Mountain cafeteria,
    near the residences. A great opportunity to meet other members and learn more about the
    process and procedures of GS. From 3:30 p.m. until 5:00 p.m., Youth members will have an
    additional orientation session (Youth members should attend both sessions.) * Dinner is
    served in the cafeteria from 5-7pm. Please eat early so you can head off to the Opening
    Service. * ALL members should assemble in the Cathedral Courtyard at 6:45 p.m. It&#146;s
    an easy walk down University Avenue to the Cathedral (approximately 15 minutes). A
    reception will follow the Service. A shuttle back to the residence, for those who need it,
    will depart following the reception.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Friday, May 22</b> * Breakfast is served in the cafeteria from
    7:00 a.m. until 8:30 a.m. It is buffet style offering hot and cold selections. (Breakfast
    follows the same pattern for all days of General Synod.) * At 8:45 a.m. members gather in
    the plenary hall for morning worship. For this day only, members will worship at their
    diocesan tables (on subsequent mornings you will worship with your assigned table groups.)
    * Following worship, Synod will be duly greeted and receive words of welcome. The next
    part of the morning will include the Primatial Address and then Synod will deal with a
    number of housekeeping resolutions. * A Eucharist (optional) will be held in Memorial Hall
    at 12:10pm * Box lunches will be available in Tomlinson Hall. You are welcome to eat your
    box lunch outside (weather permitting). After a bit of nourishment, you will have a chance
    to visit the display area where you&#146;ll find a wide array of exhibitors, Anglican Book
    Centre, the Pension department and much more. * After lunch, members should proceed
    directly to the first FORUM. Session 1,<i>www.partnerships@faith.com</i>, Will take place
    in the plenary hall, while Session 2, <i>Northern Lights</i>, will be held in the

    cold selections will be available. The Primate will dine (in a designated area of the
    cafeteria) with First Time members of Synod. * Friday evening will be spent in the plenary
    hall. * Following Night Prayers, come join us in the GS Pub! (Located in Tomlinson Hall) </font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Saturday, May 23</b> * When members arrive at the plenary hall,
    they should go directly to their assigned bible study table for morning worship (you will
    move to your diocesan table following the worship). * After a busy morning of
    presentations and resolutions, we will be joined in plenary by the participants in the
    Children&#146;s Program. At lunch time we will all process outdoors for an
    Intergenerational Eucharist. * FORUM II begins at 2:00 p.m. Session 1, <i>In Full Harmony</i>,

    of Montreal Banquet will be held in the Eaton&#146;s building (3 blocks south of the
    McCord Museum on University Avenue.) Buses, for those who need them, will be available for
    shuttle back to the residence after the Banquet.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Sunday, May 24</b> * GS members will be picked-up at McGill by
    their host parish. (If you have not heard from your host parish yet, please speak to a
    Local Arrangements volunteer at the Information Table in the display area - before Sunday)
    * FORUM III begins at 3:00 p.m. Session 1, <i>Many Voices - One Song</i>, will be held in
    the cafeteria, while Session 2, <i>Streams of Living Justice</i>, takes place in the
    plenary hall.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Monday, May 25</b> * A full day in plenary! Worship, discussion,
    resolutions and the presentation on Nation &amp; Identity.</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Tuesday, May 26</b> * Plenary adjourns at 4:00 p.m., so that
    members can attend a Eucharist at the Church of St. John the Evangelist (a short walk from
    McGill). * After the Service at St. John&#146;s, you are free to experience the sights and
    sounds of Montreal. There is something for every taste...music, entertainment, fine food,
    galleries, shopping, etc., etc. If you can&#146;t find something in Montreal to amuse you,
    check your pulse! (Sorry sports fans, the Expos are in Atlanta that night)</font></p>
    <b><p><font face="Arial">Wednesday, May 27</b> * FORUM IV will be held in the plenary hall
    (everyone participates in the one session). Please go to your assigned bible study tables.

    </i></font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Information Tables<br>
    </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Two information tables will be located in the
    display area (adjacent to the plenary hall). One table will be staffed by General Synod
    personnel while the other will be staffed by local volunteers. These tables will be
    resources of information for a variety of needs. They may not have all the answers, but
    they will know who to contact for help.</font><font size="4"><i></p>
    </i></font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Errata<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Please note the following changes in the
    Convening Circular: On page 2. of the COGS report (#003) a recipient of the Anglican Award
    of Merit is listed as Mr. Grant Walker instead of Mr. Garth Walker. In the Sessional
    Committees document, in the Worship Committee list, Eleanore Frew is listed incorrectly as
    Elizabeth.</font></p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Keeping In Touch with the Home Front<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">While you are at General Synod there are
    a number of ways that the folks back home can keep tabs on you. Broadcasts will air on
    Vision TV, each evening from Monday, May 25 to Friday, May 29. For those people who are
    &quot;on-line&quot; a great way to stay connected with GS is via the General Synod web
    site: www.anglican.ca/synod98 The web site will have the latest tally of resolutions,
    reports and commentary from the plenary sessions and &quot;real time&quot; images direct
    from the plenary floor. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone from home needs to contact a Synod member, in an
    emergency, they can leave a message by phoning: (514) 398-6367 or send a fax to: (514)
    398-6770. Messages that are received will be posted at the General Synod Information
    Table.</font></p>
    </font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Don't Forget to Bring...<br>
    </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2">An umbrella! Yes it&#146;s true...it has been
    known to rain in Montreal during the month of May. Walking outdoors is unavoidable so
    better to be &quot;dry than soggy!&quot;</font><font size="4"><i></p>
    </i></font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Last Minute Changes<br>
    </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2">The best laid plans.....there are times when
    circumstances cause GS members to have to change travel plans (arrival &amp; departure
    times, etc.) If this happens to you, please contact Susan J. Johnson, in the General
    Secretary&#146;s office, as soon as possible. </font><font size="4"><i></p>
    </i></font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>For Youth Members<br>
    </strong></font><font face="Arial" size="2">Linda Borden Taylor, the GS Youth Chaplain,
    invites the Youth members to bring with them a pamphlet, brochure or some other resource
    that describes youth ministry in their diocese. This will be a great way to learn about
    programs designed for youth in all parts of our church.</font><font size="4"><i></p>
    </i></font><p><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Profile<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial">The Convening Circular is, possibly, the
    most widely travelled &quot;member&quot; of General Synod. It made its first appearance at
    a General Synod in 1896 (it was a mere 90 pages). The Oxford English Dictionary
    description for &quot;circular&quot; is: &quot;short for circular letter of note: now esp.
    a business notice or advertisement, printed or otherwise reproduced in large numbers for
    distribution.&quot; The most common use now, besides our own &#145;convening
    circular&#146; is the &#145;Court Circular&#146; which lists the engagements of the
    British Royal Family and which is published daily in the newspapers.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Convening Circular contains reports, notices of motion,
    memorials and petitions related to the business of General Synod. Don&#146;t leave home
    without it! </font></p>

    </strong></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">No, this will not be the final
    edition of the General Synod Times! A post-GS edition will be on-line and in mail boxes in
    the weeks following Synod (after we all have a brief opportunity to catch our breath!)</font></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Name Tags<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2"><font size="2" face="Arial">Name tags at GS provide
    valuable information (in addition to helping you remember who you are!) Name tags will
    have coloured dots to help you easily identify groups of people: GS members - Red, Staff -
    Fl. Green, Partners (Ecumenical &amp; Overseas) - Green, Local Volunteers - Fl. Yellow,
    Media - Blue, &quot;others&quot; (displayers, visitors, companions, etc.) - Yellow.</font><br>
