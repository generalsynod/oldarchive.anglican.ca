</FONT><P></P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P><A NAME="Columns"><A NAME="QuickMark"></A></A>Don’t worry...it’s not what you think! At a recent meeting of the House of Bishops, a number of Bishops voiced their support and encouragement for the <B><U>G</B></U>eneral <B><U>S</B></U>ynod <B><U>T</B></U>imes (GST)! Thank you, Bishops.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>GS Chaplain</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The Rev. Gwenda Wells, of the Diocese of Montr&eacute;al, has been appointed Chaplain for General Synod ‘98. As well as assisting with the liturgy and worship, Gwenda will be available to General Synod members who would like to have a pastoral person to chat with.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Preparing for GS</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>There are many things that members should do before leaving home and heading to General Synod: read the reports and Convening Circular, pray, reflect on the issues facing our church. Another important piece of advance work is to meet with the members of your diocesan delegation (wherever possible, given time, distance, etc.) This is a great opportunity to discuss the issues and agenda, to decide which members will attend which forum and schedule times to &quot;check-in&quot; with each other during the nine days of General Synod. We encourage diocesan groups to have a pre-GS get-together over a meal (what a fabulous way to do some team building!) Most dioceses will be sending some people who have attended General Synod before and some people who will be attending for the first time. GS veterans can offer some practical tips and perspectives to the rookies.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Ministry Matters</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>A special, pre-General Synod edition of Ministry Matters is in the works for distribution to the regular subscription list and to all General Synod members in the early spring. The special edition, which will focus on Church House and the work done out of the National Office, is a series of departmental profiles. Enough copies will be printed so that dioceses and parishes wishing to have a resource on the National Office can order extra copies afterwards. It is hoped that, with periodic updates, the special edition will have a shelf life of approximately three years. For more information contact Sam Carriere at: scarriere@national.anglican.ca</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Central Travel Agent</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>Did you know that the travel budget (the cost of getting delegates to and from Montr&eacute;al) for GS ‘98 is a whopping $125,000?! A great number of people will travel by air. Our central travel agent, UNIGLOBE Vector Travel is ready and willing to assist travelers to make their arrangements. <B>We strongly urge you to use the central travel agent when booking your travel plans.</B> Among the benefits we earn, by using the central agent, are complimentary tickets. The Church (that’s you and me) will receive complimentary tickets based on a ratio of 1 for every 30 paid, plus 1 additional ticket for every 100 paid - resulting in 4 for every 100 paid. This helps lower our costs. UNIGLOBE is committed to seeking out the lowest available fares for GS members. In the next few months members will be receiving detailed information about booking travel arrangements. Please remember to use the central travel agent!!</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Anglicans &amp; Lutherans</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>For the past twelve years Canadian Lutherans and Anglicans have been meeting and discussing our shared faith and spirituality. In recent times our two churches have taken steps leading to a sharing of the eucharist. In 1995 our General Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran National Convention advanced the journey that will move our two churches towards full communion by 2001. </P>
<P>One of the actions that our two churches have agreed upon is &quot;to request all neighbouring congregations to undertake joint projects and celebrate the eucharist together annually.&quot; As we prepare for General Synod 1998 and look forward to 2001, let’s undertake to get to know our Lutheran sisters and brothers by worshiping together.</P>

</FONT><I><FONT SIZE=5><P>Priorities</P>
</I></FONT><P><FONT SIZE=3>The 34th General Synod (Ottawa ‘95) adopted a new direction for the Anglican Church of Canada. The priorities articulated in <I>Preparing the Way</I> have laid the foundation for the work of the church at the national level. At General Synod ‘98 there will be plenty of discussion about the priorities/goal areas:</P>
<P>A. Strengthen our mission and development partnerships outside Canada.</P>
<P>B. Clarify Anglican identity, doctrine, liturgy and worship.</P>
<P>C. Nurture ecumenical relationships.</P>
<P>D. Advocate social justice and prophetic mission within Canada, especially in indigenous peoples’ concerns and social, economic and environmental justice issues.</P>
<P>E. Strengthen commitment of the whole Church to domestic mission in partnership with the Council of the North, and work with the Council of the North to move toward self-sufficiency.</P>
<P>F. Provide services to dioceses - information, financial and administration.</P>
