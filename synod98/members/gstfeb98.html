    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>We're not going to let some &quot;ice storm of
    the millennium&quot; get in the way of GS planning! The lives of many people involved with
    various aspects of General Synod '98 have been directly impacted by the recent ice storm
    that swept through eastern Canada. Despite that, cplanning committee members have shown
    tremendous resolve and determination by continuing the work of preparing for General
    Synod!<br>

    </small></font><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Forum Update<br>
    </strong></font><font face="Arial"><small>Forum Goal Statement: To provide an opportunity
    for General Synod members to engage critical themes that are shaping the life of the
    Anglican Church of Canada and to explore how these themes are being experienced locally,
    nationally and internationally.<br>
    <br>
    Desired Outcomes:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    1. Awareness of the many voices in our church.<br>
    2. Clarity about the issues coming to General Synod.<br>
    3. Directions for the future.<br>

    color="#800080"><br>
    </font></strong><font face="Arial"><small>The membership of General Synod '98 will include
    some 25 Youth Members (aged 16 to 25 years.) The Rev. Linda Taylor, of the diocese of
    Montréal, has been enlisted to serve as Youth Chaplain. Linda will be a resource to
    assist Youth Members &quot;find their way around&quot; General Synod. Youth Members can
    expect to receive a mailing from Linda in the next month or so.<br>

    </small><strong><font color="#800080">General Synod Trivia</font></strong><small><br>
    The Constitution provides for clerical and lay membership based on the number of licensed
    members of the clergy above a stated minimum. In 1924, Miss Inez Smith was elected and
    certified a lay delegate for the Diocese of Caledonia. The Prolocutor ruled that she was
    ineligible to sit by reason of her gender.<br>
    Women were declared eligible for membership in 1934. In 1946, Mrs. Madeline Wodehouse,
    then National President of the Women's Auxiliary, was appointed to General Synod by the
    Bishop of Yukon, and served as the first woman member of the General Synod.<br>
    <br>
    </small><strong><font color="#800080">Parish Visits</font></strong><small><br>
    General Synod members will be afforded a number of opportunities to experience life and
    ministry in the diocese of Montréal. On Sunday May 24th, visiting diocesan delegations
    will be the guests of parishes across Montréal and area. This will be a time of worship
    and fellowship. <br>

    face="Arial"><small><br>
    The position of General Secretary of the Anglican Church of Canada is somewhat comparable
    to the position of Chief Operating Officer of a corporation. Jim Boyles has been the
    General Secretary since 1993. During his tenure Jim has provided tremendous leadership to
    the &quot;business&quot; of the national church (and I'm not just saying that because he's
    the boss!).<br>
    Jim loves General Synods! He attended Synod for the first time in Regina, 1973 (the last
    time we met in a hotel). He has served our church in a variety of ways - he staffed the
    Nominating Committee at 4 General Synods, Chaired the Nominating Committee in 1989,
    Chaired the Resolutions Committee in 1992. At the 1992 GS. Jim was elected Deputy
    Prolocutor. From 1975 until 1981, Jim was the Ecumenical Officer for the national church.<br>
    Jim, a native of Toronto, studied at Yale and was ordained in the diocese of Ottawa. In
    his free time Jim enjoys pondering about General Synod. Here's one of Jim's recent
    ponderences:<br>
    &quot;Synods are too long and therefore difficult for many lay people to attend. The next
    Synod is in July, 2001, in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, and maybe we should be looking at
    5 days.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    </small></font><font face="Arial" color="#800080"><strong>Sign Posts</strong></font><font
    face="Arial"><small><br>
    Positioned in various locations throughout the GS site, will be &quot;sign posts&quot;.
    These kiosks will be places where you (on behalf of yourself, your parish or your diocese)
    can leave a message that you would like to share with other GS members and visitors. We
    will let you know, before you come to General Synod, the desired size and format of how
    your message should be presented.<br>

    </small><font color="#800080"><strong>Lifting Every Voice In Song</strong></font><small><br>
    Patrick Wedd, the GS Musician, tells us that all of the music sung at General Synod will
    be selections from the new hymn book - Common Praise. Patrick advises us all to start
    getting into tune now, so that we will be ready to lift our voice in song!</small></font></td>
