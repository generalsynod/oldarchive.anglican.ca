   	    <h2><strong><a name="story" id="story"></a>From panic to inspiration: the story behind the video</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Lisa Barry<br />
        Senior Producer, Anglican Video</strong></p>
        <p>Being a part of the “Amazing Grace” project team from the beginning has been a fun and inspiring aspect of my work for the past year.&nbsp; I already have the best job at National Office – as senior producer for Anglican Video I get to meet a lot of wonderful and interesting people and hear amazing stories on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>Early on in this project, I committed myself to making a “compilation” video of what we hoped would be many Amazing Grace contributions that would come in from all across the Canadian Church.&nbsp; The videos began to trickle in last spring and from the start, our team was impressed and inspired by the creativity and enthusiasm with which people approached this project.&nbsp; <br />
        </p>
        <p>After Nov. 23 -- Amazing Grace Sunday -- when the trickle turned into a flood and we could suddenly barely stay on top of the logistics of the project, I began to panic. <br />
        </p>
        <p>I already had some ideas for a creative approach (helped a lot by an idea my colleague Bev Murphy tossed at me) but the sheer volume of videos was scary.&nbsp; As I screened them all, one by one, late into the nights, I wondered how I would find a way to honour them all – these beautiful faces and voices of people from all walks of life and so many different communities. <br />
        </p>
        <p>The soldiers in Kandahar singing the line “through many dangers, toils and snares, I have already come” moved me to tears.&nbsp; A small girl, guiding the child next to her with her finger on the page; the faces of elderly people in a nursing home who stood with dignity to sing this hymn; the wealthiest parishes with magnificent choirs and the humblest of congregations without even a church to call home – all, all all moved me and challenged me to share their stories with the world.</p>
        <p>My brilliant and normally unflappable editor of 15 years, Tim Ford, actually yelled at me on the first day of our edit.&nbsp; He swore too.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; “This is impossible”, he said.&nbsp; I had never heard him say that before but it was pretty overwhelming.&nbsp; All the tapes in different formats, the audio all over the place – it was a technical nightmare.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>I will spare you the details but in the end, as you will see, we worked it out.&nbsp; Even Tim, a decidedly non-religious kind of a guy, thinks we have a miracle.&nbsp; Segments from every single rendition of Amazing Grace that we received before the Dec. 1 deadline were included and the end credits list all the groups whose enthusiastic contributions made this crazy idea a resounding success. <br />
          </p>
        <p>I think the program is absolutely beautiful.&nbsp; It’s folksy and wobbly and full of Spirit and hope and I love it.    	</p>
