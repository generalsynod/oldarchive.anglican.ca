    	  <h1>Council of the North and “Amazing Grace” a match made in heaven</h1>
    	  <p>Fiona Brownlee<br />
    	    Communications Officer<br />
    	    Council of the North</p>
    	  <p>A small Sunday School in northern Labrador is struggling to find the ways to get enough resources for  the children of their community. A parish priest who has never had a church salary is working in a Cree community in northern Saskatchewan and is struggling with youth despair and youth suicide. An Inuit family from a remote community in the Arctic has a medical emergency and needs to go to Winnipeg where there are no clergy who speak their language, they wonder who will be able to come and pray with them. These are just a few of the many situations that clergy and lay leaders have to deal with on a daily basis within the dioceses which make up the Council of the North.</p>
    	  <p> The Council of the North is made up of nine (9) dioceses, the Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior  
    	    and the Archdeaconry of Labrador across the northern part of the Anglican Church of Canada. These  
    	    members of our church live in the most isolated places in the country where travel distances and costs  
    	    are amongst the highest. The challenges of providing sacramental and pastoral ministry to isolated  
    	    communities is difficult at the best of times but in times of decreasing financial resources it is even more  
    	    difficult. A significant part of the budgets of the members of the Council of the North comes from the  
    	    budget of the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada. It is a ministry of the whole church by  
    	    the whole church. </p>
    	  <p> When the membership of the Council of the North heard about the “Amazing Grace” project the general  
    	    response was excitement and deep gratitude. To think that Anglicans from coast to coast to coast will be  
    	    singing the hymn “Amazing Grace’ on the same Sunday in a variety of languages, in a variety of worship  	    settings, and that most of them will be contributing towards the ministry of the Council of the North, is  
    	    almost overwhelming for many who live and work in the north. </p>
    	  <p> The gift of money, prayer and support will enable those who work in the north to dream of ways of  
    	    doing ministry that have not been possible for many years. Some of the dreaming has included ways to  
    	    gather young leaders to vision about the future of the church in their area, increasing the training for lay  
    	    and clergy leaders, and having the ability to pay some of our clergy who are working in isolated  
    	    communities. There will be more dreaming and more implementing as time goes on. </p>
    	  <p> Megwetch. Huy’ch’q’u. Ekosi. Naqurmiik. (Thank you in Ojibway, Cowichon, Cree and Inuit.) </p>
